## 🎯 Deployment Recommendations

### Option 1: Deploy Now (Recommended)
**When**: Immediately
**Risk**: Very low
**Benefit**: Get Phase 5.1 improvements in production
**Timeline**: 15 minutes

```bash
# Steps:
1. Final build verification
2. Deploy to staging
3. Smoke test (5 min)
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor metrics
```

### Option 2: Test Thoroughly First
**When**: Before deployment
**Risk**: None (better safe)
**Benefit**: Maximum confidence
**Timeline**: 30 minutes

```bash
# Steps:
1. Start dev server: npm run dev
2. Test all routes
3. Test error boundary (deliberate error)
4. Verify FCP improvement with Lighthouse
5. Test on real mobile device
6. Then proceed with Option 1
```

### Option 3: Phase 2 Optimization First (Optional)
**When**: If time permits
**Risk**: Low (non-breaking)
**Benefit**: Even better performance
**Timeline**: 6 additional hours

```bash
# What's included:
- Service Worker (offline + caching)
- Code splitting (40-50% bundle reduction)
- Image optimization (10-15% savings)
- HTTP caching headers
```

**Estimated result**: 9.2/10 overall score
