## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q1: What if someone steals my fingerprints?**
> "Great question! Even if someone has your fingerprint image, they can't derive your DID without the helper data, which is encrypted on your device. And the system includes liveness detection to prevent spoofing with fake fingerprints."

**Q2: What about privacy regulations like GDPR?**
> "We're fully GDPR compliant under Article 9. The key is that we never store or transmit raw biometric data. Only cryptographic hashes are used, and they're non-reversible. We have full documentation on GDPR/CCPA compliance in our repo."

**Q3: What if I lose my phone?**
> "Your DID is on the Cardano blockchain, so it's permanent. To access it from a new device, you'll need to re-enroll your fingerprints. The system will recognize that this DID already exists and give you recovery options. You can also set up multi-controller mode to use a backup wallet."

**Q4: How does this compare to other biometric systems?**
> "Most biometric systems store templates in centralized databases - that's the breach risk. We use a fuzzy extractor that generates cryptographic keys locally. No templates ever leave your device. Plus, we're on a public blockchain, so there's no central authority that can be compromised."

**Q5: What's the business model?**
> "We're freemium: basic DID creation is free, premium features are $5/month. For enterprises, we offer licensing ($50K-500K/year) and API-as-a-service ($0.001 per call). The key is keeping consumer access affordable while monetizing high-volume enterprise use."

**Q6: Why Cardano?**
> "Three reasons: 1) Lowest transaction fees among major blockchains, 2) Proof-of-stake is energy-efficient, 3) Strong academic research foundation and formal verification. We're blockchain-agnostic in architecture, so we could add other chains if needed."

**Q7: What about quantum computing threats?**
> "BLAKE2b, our hash function, is considered quantum-resistant for the foreseeable future (20+ years). We're also watching NIST's post-quantum cryptography standards. When they finalize, we can upgrade the hashing algorithm without changing the overall architecture."

**Q8: Can this work for elderly or disabled users?**
> "Yes! We have full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility - screen reader support, high contrast mode, large touch targets. For users who can't use fingerprints, we're adding iris and face recognition in Phase 7. The system is designed to be inclusive."

**Q9: How do you prevent duplicate enrollments (Sybil attacks)?**
> "That's the beauty of deterministic generation. If someone tries to enroll the same fingerprints twice, they'll get the same DID. The blockchain prevents creating duplicate DIDs. So one person = one DID, enforced cryptographically."

**Q10: Is this open source?**
> "100% open source, Apache 2.0 license. Everything - the SDK, API servers, demo wallet, even this pitch deck - is on GitHub. We believe identity infrastructure should be transparent and community-owned."
