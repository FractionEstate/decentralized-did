## Demo 1: Privacy Protection (3 minutes)

### Attack: Intercept Biometric Data

**Scenario**: Attacker monitors network traffic during enrollment

**Setup**:
```bash
# Start packet capture
tcpdump -i any -w /tmp/capture.pcap

# In another terminal, start the API server
cd core/api && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Actions**:
1. Begin enrollment on mobile app
2. Capture all 10 fingerprints
3. Complete DID generation
4. Stop packet capture

**Analysis**:
```bash
# Convert pcap to readable format
tshark -r /tmp/capture.pcap -Y http -T fields \
  -e http.request.method \
  -e http.request.uri \
  -e http.file_data

# Search for biometric data
strings /tmp/capture.pcap | grep -i "fingerprint\|minutiae\|image"
```

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ NO raw fingerprint images found
✅ NO minutiae templates found
✅ Only cryptographic hashes visible (non-reversible)
✅ Helper data is encrypted (AES-256)
```

**Proof Statement**:
> "Even with complete network access, an attacker sees only encrypted blobs and irreversible hashes. Raw biometric data never leaves the device."

## Demo 2: Blockchain Immutability (2 minutes)

### Attack: Modify Existing DID Record

**Scenario**: Attacker tries to alter DID metadata on blockchain

**Setup**:
```bash
# Query existing DID transaction
cardano-cli query utxo \
  --address $(cat did-address.txt) \
  --mainnet

# Save transaction hash
TX_HASH="abc123..."
```

**Attempted Attack**:
```bash
# Try to modify metadata (this will fail)
cardano-cli transaction build \
  --tx-in ${TX_HASH}#0 \
  --tx-out ${ADDRESS}+${AMOUNT} \
  --metadata-json-file modified-metadata.json \
  --mainnet

# Output: ERROR - cannot spend someone else's UTXO
```

**Alternative Attack - Double Spend**:
```bash
# Try to create conflicting transaction
cardano-cli transaction build \
  --tx-in ${TX_HASH}#0 \
  --tx-out ${DIFFERENT_ADDRESS}+${AMOUNT} \
  --mainnet

# Output: ERROR - UTXO already spent
```

**Expected Result**:
```
❌ Cannot modify existing metadata
❌ Cannot delete DID record
❌ Cannot double-spend UTXO
✅ Blockchain consensus rejects invalid transactions
```

**Proof Statement**:
> "Once a DID is on the Cardano blockchain, it's mathematically impossible to alter. You'd need to control 51% of the network - that's billions of dollars and thousands of nodes."

## Demo 3: Fuzzy Extractor Robustness (4 minutes)

### Attack: Derive DID from Similar Fingerprints

**Scenario**: Attacker tries to impersonate with high-quality fingerprint replica

**Setup**:
```python
# Load original enrollment
from decentralized_did.biometric.fuzzy_extractor import FuzzyExtractor
from decentralized_did.biometric.types import FingerTemplate

original_template = load_template("enrolled_finger.dat")
original_did = FuzzyExtractor.extract(original_template)

print(f"Original DID: {original_did}")
```

**Attack 1 - Random Fingerprint**:
```python
# Generate random minutiae (completely different person)
fake_template = generate_random_template(num_minutiae=128)
fake_did = FuzzyExtractor.extract(fake_template)

print(f"Fake DID: {fake_did}")
print(f"Match: {original_did == fake_did}")  # False
```

**Attack 2 - Modified Fingerprint**:
```python
# Slightly modify original (simulating poor-quality replica)
modified_template = add_noise(original_template, noise_level=0.1)
modified_did = FuzzyExtractor.extract(modified_template, helper=original_helper)

print(f"Modified DID: {modified_did}")
print(f"Match: {original_did == modified_did}")  # False (outside BCH tolerance)
```

**Attack 3 - Partial Match**:
```python
# Use only 50% of minutiae points (stolen template)
partial_template = original_template[:64]  # Half of 128 points
partial_did = FuzzyExtractor.extract(partial_template, helper=original_helper)

print(f"Partial DID: {partial_did}")
print(f"Match: {original_did == partial_did}")  # False (insufficient data)
```

**Legitimate Recovery**:
```python
# Real user with minor finger injury (20% noise)
injured_template = add_realistic_noise(original_template, noise_level=0.2)
recovered_did = FuzzyExtractor.extract(injured_template, helper=original_helper)

print(f"Recovered DID: {recovered_did}")
print(f"Match: {original_did == recovered_did}")  # True (within BCH tolerance)
```

**Expected Results**:
```
✅ Random fingerprint: No match (different DID)
✅ Modified fingerprint: No match (outside error tolerance)
✅ Partial fingerprint: No match (insufficient entropy)
✅ Injured legitimate finger: Match! (error correction works)
```

**Proof Statement**:
> "The fuzzy extractor is designed to tolerate natural variation (injuries, aging) but reject forgeries. An attacker would need a near-perfect replica of all 10 fingers - practically impossible."

## Demo 4: Sybil Attack Prevention (3 minutes)

### Attack: Create Multiple DIDs from Same Biometrics

**Scenario**: User tries to create multiple identities (voting fraud, benefit fraud)

**Setup**:
```python
from decentralized_did.did.generator import generate_deterministic_did
from decentralized_did.biometric.aggregator import aggregate_10_fingers

# Enroll once
fingers_1 = capture_10_fingers()
commitment_1 = aggregate_10_fingers(fingers_1)
did_1 = generate_deterministic_did(commitment_1)

print(f"First DID: {did_1}")
```

**Attack - Re-enroll Same Fingerprints**:
```python
# Try to enroll again (same person, same day)
fingers_2 = capture_10_fingers()  # Same physical fingers
commitment_2 = aggregate_10_fingers(fingers_2)
did_2 = generate_deterministic_did(commitment_2)

print(f"Second DID: {did_2}")
print(f"Match: {did_1 == did_2}")  # True - same DID!
```

**Attack - Vary Order of Fingers**:
```python
# Try different finger order (swap left/right thumbs)
fingers_3 = [fingers_1[1], fingers_1[0]] + fingers_1[2:]
commitment_3 = aggregate_10_fingers(fingers_3)
did_3 = generate_deterministic_did(commitment_3)

print(f"Third DID: {did_3}")
print(f"Match: {did_1 == did_3}")  # True - order-independent aggregation
```

**Attack - Use Different Wallet**:
```python
# Try with different wallet address
did_4 = generate_deterministic_did(commitment_1, wallet="addr1qy...")

print(f"Fourth DID: {did_4}")
print(f"Match: {did_1 == did_4}")  # True - wallet not part of DID
```

**Expected Results**:
```
✅ Same biometrics → Same DID (always)
✅ Different finger order → Same DID (order-independent)
✅ Different wallet → Same DID (wallet-agnostic)
✅ Blockchain rejects duplicate DID creation
```

**Proof Statement**:
> "One person, one DID - enforced mathematically. No matter how many times you try, the same fingerprints always produce the same DID. This makes voting fraud and identity duplication cryptographically impossible."

## Demo 5: API Attack Vectors (3 minutes)

### Attack 1: Rate Limiting Bypass

**Scenario**: Attacker tries brute-force verification

**Setup**:
```bash
# Target: POST /api/v1/did/verify
# Rate limit: 30 requests/minute

# Attack script
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/did/verify \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"did": "did:cardano:mainnet:zQmX...", "template": "fake"}' \
    &
done
```

**Expected Result**:
```
Request 1-30: HTTP 200 (normal responses, all fail verification)
Request 31+: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
Body: {"detail": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds."}

✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force
✅ Audit log records attack attempt
```

### Attack 2: JWT Token Forgery

**Scenario**: Attacker tries to forge authentication token

**Setup**:
```python
import jwt

# Try to forge token without secret key
fake_token = jwt.encode(
    {"sub": "admin", "exp": 9999999999},
    "wrong-secret",
    algorithm="HS256"
)

# Send request with forged token
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/users",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {fake_token}"}
)
```

**Expected Result**:
```
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
Body: {"detail": "Invalid token signature"}

✅ HMAC-SHA256 prevents token forgery
✅ Tokens expire after 24 hours
```

### Attack 3: SQL Injection

**Scenario**: Attacker tries to inject malicious SQL

**Setup**:
```bash
# Attempt SQL injection in DID parameter
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/did/did:cardano:mainnet:zQm'; DROP TABLE users; --/metadata"
```

**Expected Result**:
```
HTTP 400 Bad Request
Body: {"detail": "Invalid DID format"}

✅ Input validation prevents SQL injection
✅ Parameterized queries (not string concatenation)
✅ No database access in this endpoint (blockchain-based)
```

---

## Demo 6: Mobile Security (2 minutes)

### Attack: Reverse Engineer APK

**Scenario**: Attacker decompiles APK to steal secrets

**Setup**:
```bash
# Decompile release APK
apktool d demo-wallet-release.apk -o /tmp/decompiled

# Search for secrets
grep -r "API_KEY\|SECRET\|PASSWORD" /tmp/decompiled/
```

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ No hardcoded API keys (loaded from environment)
✅ No private keys in APK (generated on-device)
✅ No fingerprint templates (only hashes)
✅ ProGuard/R8 obfuscation applied
```

**Additional Checks**:
```bash
# Check for debug logs
grep -r "console.log\|System.out.println" /tmp/decompiled/

# Check for insecure storage
grep -r "localStorage\|SharedPreferences" /tmp/decompiled/
```

**Proof Statement**:
> "The APK contains zero secrets. All cryptographic operations happen on-device with locally generated keys. Even full access to the APK reveals nothing sensitive."

---

## Demo 7: Liveness Detection (Bonus)

### Attack: Present Fake Fingerprint

**Scenario**: Attacker uses silicone/gelatin fingerprint replica

**Setup**:
```python
from decentralized_did.biometric.liveness import detect_liveness

# Capture from real finger
real_sensor_data = capture_sensor_reading()
liveness_score_real = detect_liveness(real_sensor_data)

print(f"Real finger liveness: {liveness_score_real}")  # 0.95 (high confidence)

# Simulate fake finger (different electrical properties)
fake_sensor_data = simulate_fake_finger()
liveness_score_fake = detect_liveness(fake_sensor_data)

print(f"Fake finger liveness: {liveness_score_fake}")  # 0.15 (low confidence)
```

**Detection Methods**:
1. **Electrical conductivity** - Real skin has specific resistance
2. **Temperature** - Body temp ~98.6°F (37°C)
3. **Pulse detection** - Capillary blood flow visible in ridges
4. **3D depth** - Fake fingerprints are 2D

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ Real finger: Liveness score > 0.8 (pass)
✅ Fake finger: Liveness score < 0.5 (reject)
✅ User sees: "Liveness check failed. Please use a real finger."
```

## Q&A: Advanced Security Questions

**Q1: What about deepfake fingerprints?**
> "Liveness detection prevents this. We check electrical conductivity, temperature, and pulse - all impossible to fake with current deepfake technology. As deepfakes evolve, we'll add AI-based liveness models."

**Q2: Can law enforcement compel you to unlock with fingerprint?**
> "This varies by jurisdiction. In the US, 5th Amendment protections for biometrics are evolving. We recommend users in sensitive situations enable multi-factor (PIN + fingerprint) or use the 'panic mode' that temporarily disables biometric unlock."

**Q3: What if quantum computers break your encryption?**
> "BLAKE2b is quantum-resistant for the foreseeable future. We're tracking NIST's post-quantum cryptography standards. When finalized (expected 2026), we'll upgrade the hash function. The beauty is the DID format stays the same - only internal cryptography changes."

**Q4: How do you prevent database dumps from leaking DIDs?**
> "We don't have a traditional database. DIDs are on the public Cardano blockchain by design. The key is that DIDs contain zero personal information. Knowing someone's DID tells you nothing about them - it's like knowing their phone number."

**Q5: What's your bug bounty program?**
> "Up to $10,000 for critical vulnerabilities. Scope includes the SDK, API servers, and mobile app. See SECURITY.md in our GitHub repo for details. We also run quarterly external penetration tests."
