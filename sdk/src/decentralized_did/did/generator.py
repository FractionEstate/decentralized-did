    Generate deterministic DID from biometric commitment.

    The DID is computed as a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the fuzzy commitment,
    then Base58-encoded for human readability. This ensures:
    1. Same fingerprints always produce the same DID
    2. Different fingerprints produce different DIDs (collision-resistant)
    3. DID reveals nothing about the biometric data (one-way hash)

    Example:
        >>> commitment = b"\\x01\\x02\\x03..." # Fuzzy commitment
