# Task 4 Phase 1.3 Progress Summary

**Phase**: Phase 1.3 – Mock API Server Setup
**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Time**: 1.5 hours

---

## Objectives

- Enable deterministic responses from the mock API so identical requests yield identical DIDs and helper data.
- Validate that `/api/biometric/verify` succeeds when `expected_id_hash` matches the helper-derived hash.
- Document repeatable startup procedures and environment overrides for CI/local testing.
- Extend the authentication test harness to exercise the mock server end-to-end.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Deterministic Mock Helper Generation (`api_server_mock.py`)
- Replaced all random bytes with Blake2b-derived sequences scoped by `finger_id`.
- Added reusable `_encode_b64`, `_deterministic_bytes`, and `compute_helper_hash()` utilities.
- `id_hash` now derives from helper data; repeated enrollments with the same payload produce identical IDs.
- Verification recomputes the helper hash and requires `expected_id_hash` parity before passing.
- Introduced `MOCK_API_HOST`, `MOCK_API_PORT`, and `MOCK_API_RELOAD` env overrides.

### 2. Test Harness Updates (`test_api_auth.sh`)
- Added a `mock` mode (`./test_api_auth.sh mock`) with deterministic response checks.
- Captures helper payloads from the generate response and reuses them during verification.
- Validates CIP-30 metadata `idHash` alignment and enforces helper presence.
- Outputs mock API URL alongside basic/secure URLs; supports `MOCK_API_URL` overrides.

### 3. Documentation Refresh (`docs/API-TEST-CONFIGURATION.md`)
- Updated status to cover Phase 1.2–1.3 (secure + mock).
- Mock server overview now reflects tested status, deterministic hashing, and port overrides.
- Added "Mock Server Quickstart" with startup commands and test suite usage.
- Clarified environment notes for secure port selection and helper hash verification.

## Testing

```bash
# Secure server (port 8001) – previously validated in Phase 1.2
API_SECRET_KEY=... JWT_SECRET_KEY=... uvicorn api_server_secure:app --port 8001
SECURE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001 ./test_api_auth.sh secure

# Mock server (port 8002)
uvicorn api_server_mock:app --port 8002 --log-level info &
MOCK_API_URL=http://localhost:8002 ./test_api_auth.sh mock
```

**Mock test assertions:**
- `/health` returns `status: healthy`.
- Two consecutive `/generate` calls return identical `did` and `id_hash` values.
- `/verify` returns `success: true` when using captured helper data and `expected_id_hash`.

## Follow-Ups

1. Track helper-data schema parity (personalization/HMAC) for alignment with secure server expectations (Phase 1.4).
2. Evaluate adding a lightweight pytest wrapper around the mock API for CI sanity checks.
3. Sync demo-wallet integration tests to target the deterministic mock server by default for fast feedback.
