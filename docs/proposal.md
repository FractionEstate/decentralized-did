# Decentralized Anonymous Digital Identity on Cardano

## Vision
Create a privacy-preserving digital identity primitive that allows any Cardano wallet holder to anchor a biometric-derived identifier on-chain without revealing personally identifiable information or relying on a centralized registrar.

## Problem Statement
- Cardano lacks a standardized, privacy-preserving way to bind a human to a wallet address without leaking personal data.
- Existing identity frameworks either depend on centralized issuers or expose more biometric information than necessary.
- Hackathon teams require a concrete, end-to-end reference implementation to experiment with biometric-backed decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

## Proposed Solution
1. Capture minutiae-level features for all ten fingers using commodity fingerprint readers.
2. Normalize and quantize those features locally so repeated scans remain stable even with minor noise.
3. Run a lightweight fuzzy extractor that turns the quantized template into a reproducible, collision-resistant 256-bit digest plus privacy-preserving helper data.
4. Deterministically derive a DID fragment and wallet metadata payload from the aggregated digest.
5. Store only the digest and helper data as wallet metadata, never the raw biometric samples.
6. Expose reference tooling (CLI + library) that demonstrates enrollment, verification, and metadata generation.

## Differentiators
- Anonymous-by-design: No personal information beyond the biometric-derived digest ever leaves the user’s device.
- Decentralized trust: All verification logic is open source; no single actor controls issuance or revocation.
- Cardano-native: Metadata layout follows Cardano conventions so integrators can plug into wallets, Plutus contracts, or governance tools.

## Hackathon Scope
| Workstream | Goal | Deliverable |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Research & Design | Map requirements, constraints, and threat model | Architecture deck, privacy analysis |
| Prototype | Implement deterministic biometric pipeline + DID generator | Python package, CLI demo |
| On-chain Strategy | Define how metadata fits into Cardano | Metadata schema, integration guide |
| Governance | Outline decision-making & upgrades | Governance playbook |
| Testing & Validation | Unit tests + reproducibility harness | Pytest suite, sample data |

## Success Criteria
- Deterministic digest generation across noisy inputs (<=2% variance in sample tests).
- CLI can enroll sample fingerprints, emit metadata JSON, and verify subsequent scans offline.
- Documentation enables another hackathon team to understand, deploy, and extend the prototype inside a weekend.
- Clear roadmap for post-hackathon evolution, including potential Plutus smart contract hooks.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **False matches**: Use conservative quantization + helper data checks; document limits transparently.
- **Template leakage**: Helper data is cryptographically hardened; roadmap includes secure enclaves for raw capture.
- **Governance disputes**: Publish open governance framework and community RFC cadence.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Finalize biometric data schema and helper data format.
2. Build deterministic hashing pipeline for ten-finger aggregation.
3. Define Cardano metadata schema and DID method string.
4. Package CLI workflow and write developer quickstart.
5. Run reproducibility tests with synthetic minutiae sets.
