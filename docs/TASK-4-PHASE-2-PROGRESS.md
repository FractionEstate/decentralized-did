# Task 4 Phase 2 Progress Summary

**Phase**: Phase 2 - Demo Wallet Integration Tests
**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress - API-backed Jest suite now passes against mock, basic, and secure servers (coverage thresholds pending update)

---

## Objectives (In Progress)
- Exercise the nine deferred demo-wallet integration tests against every API deployment
- Record deterministic DID behaviour (enrollment/verification) with v1.1 metadata
- Capture baseline latency measurements to inform Phase 2.4 performance benchmarks
- Identify remaining negative cases (duplicate detection, network error handling) for upcoming sessions

---

## Work Completed - October 17, 2025

### 1. Integration Suite Execution
- Enabled `RUN_API_TESTS=true` and ran `npm test -- biometricDidService.integration.test.ts --runInBand` for each server profile
- Captured deterministic DID outputs, helper storage persistence, and verification outcomes across three runs
- Recorded timing logs embedded in the Jest suite for enrollment and verification steps

| Server | Auth Mode | Env Overrides | Tests (pass/fail) | Enrollment (ms) | Verification (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mock (`api_server_mock.py`) | None | `BIOMETRIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8002` | 14/14 | 1.42 | 1.22 |
| Basic (`api_server.py`) | None (auth cleared) | `BIOMETRIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`, `API_KEY= API_SECRET_KEY=` | 14/14 | 1.34 | 1.17 |
| Secure (`api_server_secure.py`) | JWT bearer | `BIOMETRIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001`, `BIOMETRIC_API_KEY=test_api_key_admin_32_chars_long_abcdef123456` | 14/14 | 2.24 | 1.90 |

### 2. Environment Guardrails
- Documented the need to blank `API_KEY`/`API_SECRET_KEY` when targeting the unauthenticated basic server (client otherwise attempts `/auth/token` at `SECURE_API_URL`)
- Confirmed `.env.test` defaults remain valid for secure server runs (rate limiting, audit logging disabled for deterministic testing)

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated `docs/API-TEST-CONFIGURATION.md` with explicit instructions for clearing shared auth variables during basic-server test runs
- Advanced the Phase 2 checklist in `docs/TASK-4-INTEGRATION-TESTING-PLAN.md` and added a consolidated test-run summary table

---

## Issues & Follow-Ups
- Jest exits with status `1` because legacy global coverage thresholds (80% statements/lines) remain unmet for the expanded integration suite. Assertions pass; threshold tuning will be handled separately.
- Duplicate DID detection (Blockfrost) and network/time-out failure scenarios remain outstanding (requires enabling remote lookups and mock fault injection).
- External helper storage path remains untested; will require Phase 3 mock fixtures or temporary API flags.
- Performance benchmarks currently use single-sample latency logs; collecting distribution metrics (P50/P95/P99) is still to-do.

---

## Next Steps
1. Exercise duplicate DID detection flows (mock Blockfrost or enable testnet key) and capture resulting conflict responses.
2. Add negative-path tests for network interruptions and helper URI fetch failures.
3. Extend performance harness to gather latency distributions over multiple iterations (targeting Phase 2.4 deliverables).
4. Update Jest coverage thresholds or split integration suite into a non-covered target to restore zero-exit-code pipelines.
