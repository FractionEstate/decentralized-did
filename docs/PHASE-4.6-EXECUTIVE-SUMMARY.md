- **Complexity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: HIGH (blocks user-facing functionality)
- **Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
- **Risk**: MEDIUM (breaking existing wallet features)

**Why This Matters**:
- Demo wallet currently uses legacy format (`did:cardano:{wallet}#{hash}`)
- Phase 4.5 updated all API servers to deterministic format
- **Mismatch blocks end-to-end testing and demos**
- Critical for stakeholder demonstrations

**What Changes**:
- 4-5 TypeScript/React files
- Core DID generation logic
- API integration (remove wallet_address parameter)
