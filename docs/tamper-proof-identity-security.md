## Threat Model

### Threats We Must Prevent

#### 1. **Identity Theft** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Someone steals your DID and impersonates you.

**Defenses**:
- ✅ **Biometric verification required**: Cannot use DID without fingerprints
- ✅ **Wallet signature required**: Multi-factor (biometrics + crypto keys)
- ✅ **One-way commitment**: Cannot reconstruct fingerprints from DID
- 🔄 **Liveness detection**: Prevents fake fingerprints (Phase 5)
- 🔄 **Device binding**: Trusted hardware only (Phase 5)

**Result**: ✅ PREVENTED - Attacker needs both biometrics AND wallet keys

---

#### 2. **Sybil Attack** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Attack**: One person creates multiple identities.

**Defenses**:
- ✅ **Deterministic DID**: Same biometrics → Same DID (always)
- ✅ **Cryptographic binding**: DID = Hash(fingerprints)
- ✅ **Blockchain query**: Check for existing DID before enrollment
- ✅ **Immutable record**: Cannot delete previous enrollments

**Result**: ✅ PREVENTED - One person = One DID (cryptographically enforced)

---

#### 3. **Tampering with DID Document** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Modify DID document to change identity properties.

**Defenses**:
- ✅ **Blockchain immutability**: Cannot modify past transactions
- ✅ **Append-only updates**: All changes are recorded, never deleted
- ✅ **Digital signatures**: Every update signed by controller
- ✅ **Block height ordering**: Temporal proof (what happened when)
- ✅ **Metadata hash**: Integrity verification

**Result**: ✅ PREVENTED - All changes auditable, cannot hide modifications

---

#### 4. **Presentation Attacks** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Use fake fingerprints (photos, molds, spoofs).

**Defenses**:
- 📋 **Liveness detection**: Required in hardware specification
- 📋 **Pulse detection**: Detects blood flow in finger
- 📋 **Electrical conductivity**: Detects living tissue
- 📋 **3D depth sensing**: Detects actual finger vs flat image
- 🔄 **Challenge-response**: Random verification patterns (Phase 5)

**Result**: ⚠️ HARDWARE-DEPENDENT - Requires proper sensor (documented)

---

#### 5. **Replay Attacks** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Reuse old biometric verification to authenticate.

**Defenses**:
- ✅ **Timestamp + nonce**: Every verification unique
- ✅ **Challenge-response**: Server provides random challenge
- ✅ **Session tokens**: Short-lived authentication
- 🔄 **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Prove possession without revealing (Phase 6)

**Result**: ✅ PREVENTED - Each verification is unique

---

#### 6. **Database Compromise** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Attacker steals biometric template database.

**Defenses**:
- ✅ **No central database**: Decentralized on blockchain
- ✅ **Fuzzy commitment**: Cannot reconstruct fingerprints from helper data
- ✅ **One-way hash**: DID reveals nothing about biometrics
- ✅ **Client-side enrollment**: Biometrics never leave device
- ✅ **Encrypted helper data**: AES-256 encryption (optional)

**Result**: ✅ MITIGATED - Even if blockchain leaked, fingerprints safe

---

#### 7. **Social Engineering** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Trick user into revealing biometrics or keys.

**Defenses**:
- 📋 **User education**: Clear security warnings
- 📋 **Trusted enrollment centers**: Official registration points
- 📋 **Multi-factor confirmation**: Require explicit consent
- 🔄 **Rate limiting**: Limit verification attempts (Phase 5)

**Result**: ⚠️ EDUCATION-DEPENDENT - Cannot fully prevent

---

#### 8. **Coercion** (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Attack**: Force someone to use their biometrics under duress.

**Defenses**:
- 🔄 **Duress patterns**: Special finger position signals coercion (Phase 5)
- 🔄 **Time-delay unlock**: Emergency contacts notified (Phase 5)
- 📋 **Legal protections**: Anti-coercion laws
- 🔄 **Trusted witnesses**: Multi-party verification (Phase 6)

**Result**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY MITIGATED - Difficult to fully prevent

---

## Tamper-Proof Architecture

### Blockchain Immutability

**Property**: Once written to blockchain, data cannot be modified or deleted.

```
Enrollment Transaction (Block N):
{
  "674": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "did": "did:cardano:mainnet:zQmXyZ...",
    "operation": "enrollment",
    "biometricCommitment": "0x1a2b3c...",
    "helperData": "...",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z",
    "blockHeight": 8123456,
    "signature": "0xabcdef..."
  }
}

Result: IMMUTABLE ✅
- Cannot change commitment
- Cannot delete transaction
- Cannot alter timestamp
- All nodes have copy
```

### Append-Only Updates

**Property**: Updates create new records, never modify existing ones.

```
Timeline for DID did:cardano:mainnet:zQmXyZ...

Block 8123456 (Oct 14, 2025):
  Operation: enrollment
  Commitment: 0x1a2b3c...
  Controller: addr1_wallet_a

Block 8234567 (Nov 1, 2025):
  Operation: add_controller
  New controller: addr1_wallet_b
  Signature: addr1_wallet_a (authorized)

Block 8345678 (Dec 15, 2025):
  Operation: remove_controller
  Removed: addr1_wallet_a (compromised)
  Signature: addr1_wallet_b (authorized)

Query Result:
- All 3 transactions visible
- Complete audit trail
- Current state = latest transaction
- Cannot hide history ✅
```

### Cryptographic Proof Chain

```
Enrollment Proof:
1. Biometric commitment: C = FuzzyCommit(fingerprints)
2. DID generation: DID = BLAKE2b(C)
3. Signature: Sig = Sign(DID + metadata, wallet_key)
4. Blockchain proof: TX included in block N
5. Confirmation: N+6 blocks (finality)

Verification:
1. Query blockchain for DID
2. Verify signature with controller's public key
3. Check block confirmations (>6)
4. Reconstruct commitment from helper data + fingerprints
5. Verify DID = BLAKE2b(reconstructed_commitment)

Result: Cryptographically proven authenticity ✅
```

---

## Identity Theft Prevention

### Multi-Factor Authentication

**Requirement**: Both biometrics AND wallet signature required.

```python
def authenticate_with_did(did: str, fingerprints: bytes, wallet_key: PrivateKey) -> bool:
    """
    Authenticate user with biometric DID.

    Requires BOTH:
    1. Correct fingerprints (biometric factor)
    2. Controller wallet signature (possession factor)
    """
    # Step 1: Verify biometric ownership
    commitment = fuzzy_commit(fingerprints)
    computed_did = generate_deterministic_did(commitment)

    if computed_did != did:
        return False  # Wrong biometrics

    # Step 2: Verify wallet ownership
    challenge = generate_random_challenge()
    signature = wallet_key.sign(challenge)

    if not verify_signature(signature, did, challenge):
        return False  # Wrong wallet

    # Both factors verified ✅
    return True
```

**Security**: Attacker needs to steal BOTH your fingerprints AND wallet keys.

### Liveness Detection (Hardware Requirement)

**Purpose**: Prevent fake fingerprints (photos, molds, spoofs).

**Required Hardware Features**:

| Feature | Technology | Detection |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Pulse Oximetry** | LED + photodetector | Blood flow (60-100 BPM) |
| **Capacitive Sensing** | Electric field | Living tissue vs dead/fake |
| **Thermal Sensing** | Temperature probe | Body temperature (35-37°C) |
| **3D Structure** | Ultrasonic/optical | Finger ridges vs flat image |
| **Pressure Sensing** | Force sensors | Real finger pressure profile |
| **Sweat Pores** | High-resolution | Perspiration detection |

**Recommended Sensors**:
- **Mobile**: Apple Touch ID / Face ID, Android BiometricPrompt
- **Desktop**: HID DigitalPersona U.are.U 5160 (liveness detection)
- **Government**: Integrated Biometrics Kojak (FBI-certified)

**Certification**: FIDO Level 2 or higher

### Rate Limiting

**Purpose**: Prevent brute-force biometric attacks.

```python
class RateLimiter:
    """Prevent rapid authentication attempts."""

    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5
    LOCKOUT_DURATION = 3600  # 1 hour

    def check_attempt(self, did: str) -> bool:
        attempts = get_failed_attempts(did)

        if attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS:
            lockout_time = get_lockout_start(did)
            if time.time() - lockout_time < LOCKOUT_DURATION:
                raise RateLimitError(
                    f"Too many failed attempts. "
                    f"Locked out for {LOCKOUT_DURATION/60} minutes."
                )

        return True

# After 5 failed attempts → 1 hour lockout
# Prevents: Brute-force biometric spoofing
```

### Device Binding (Optional)

**Purpose**: Restrict DID usage to trusted devices.

```json
{
  "did": "did:cardano:mainnet:zQmXyZ...",
  "trustedDevices": [
    {
      "deviceId": "iPhone-12-SN123456",
      "publicKey": "0xabcdef...",
      "enrolled": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z",
      "attestation": "Apple Secure Enclave"
    },
    {
      "deviceId": "Ledger-Nano-X-SN789012",
      "publicKey": "0x123456...",
      "enrolled": "2025-10-20T15:30:00Z",
      "attestation": "Ledger SE"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security**: Only pre-registered devices can authenticate with DID.

---

## One Person = One Identity

### Deterministic DID Generation (IMPLEMENTED ✅)

```
Same Biometrics → Same DID (ALWAYS)

Alice's fingerprints:
  Attempt 1 (Wallet A) → did:cardano:mainnet:zQmAbc123
  Attempt 2 (Wallet B) → did:cardano:mainnet:zQmAbc123 (SAME)
  Attempt 3 (Wallet C) → did:cardano:mainnet:zQmAbc123 (SAME)

Result: Alice has ONE identity across all wallets ✅

Bob's fingerprints (different):
  Attempt 1 → did:cardano:mainnet:zQmXyz789 (DIFFERENT)

Result: Each person gets exactly ONE unique DID ✅
```

### Duplicate Enrollment Prevention

**Implementation** (Phase 4.5):

```python
def enroll_biometric_did(fingerprints: bytes, wallet: Address) -> str:
    """
    Enroll biometric DID with duplicate detection.

    Raises:
        DuplicateEnrollmentError: If DID already exists
    """
    # Generate deterministic DID
    commitment = fuzzy_commit(fingerprints)
    did = generate_deterministic_did(commitment)

    # Check if DID already exists on blockchain
    existing_did = query_blockchain(did)

    if existing_did:
        raise DuplicateEnrollmentError(
            f"DID {did} already enrolled on "
            f"{existing_did['enrollment_date']}. "
            f"Cannot create duplicate identity. "
            f"If you own this DID, add this wallet as controller instead."
        )

    # Proceed with enrollment
    metadata = build_enrollment_metadata(did, commitment, wallet)
    tx = build_transaction(metadata)
    submit_to_blockchain(tx)

    return did
```

**User Experience**:

```
Scenario 1: New user (Bob)
  → Scan fingerprints
  → Generate DID: did:cardano:mainnet:zQmBob456
  → Check blockchain: Not found ✓
  → Proceed with enrollment
  → Success! ✅

Scenario 2: Existing user (Alice) with new wallet
  → Scan fingerprints
  → Generate DID: did:cardano:mainnet:zQmAlice123
  → Check blockchain: FOUND (enrolled Oct 14, 2025)
  → Error: "DID already exists. To use this wallet, add it as controller."
  → Option 1: Add wallet as controller (requires existing wallet signature)
  → Option 2: Cancel
```

### Blockchain Query Before Enrollment

```python
async def query_existing_did(did: str) -> Optional[DIDRecord]:
  """Query Koios for an existing DID enrollment."""
  enrollment = await koios_client.check_did_exists(did, label="674")
  if enrollment is None:
    return None

  return DIDRecord(
    tx_hash=enrollment["tx_hash"],
    controllers=enrollment.get("controllers", []),
    enrolled_at=enrollment.get("enrollment_timestamp"),
    revoked=enrollment.get("revoked", False),
        did=did,
        enrollment_date=enrollment.timestamp,
        block_height=enrollment.block_height,
        controllers=get_controllers(did),
        status="active"
    )
```

---

## Enrollment Security

### Quality Checks (CRITICAL)

**Purpose**: Ensure high-quality biometric enrollment for reliable verification.

```python
class EnrollmentQualityChecker:
    """Validate biometric quality before enrollment."""

    # NIST quality thresholds
    MIN_QUALITY_SCORE = 60  # 0-100 scale
    MIN_MINUTIAE_COUNT = 12  # Per fingerprint
    MIN_FINGERPRINTS = 4     # For strong assurance

    def validate_fingerprint(self, image: np.ndarray) -> QualityScore:
        """Validate single fingerprint quality."""

        # 1. Image quality
        contrast = compute_contrast(image)
        if contrast < 0.5:
            raise LowQualityError("Image contrast too low. Clean sensor and retry.")

        # 2. Ridge clarity
        ridge_flow = compute_ridge_flow(image)
        if ridge_flow.clarity < 0.6:
            raise LowQualityError("Ridge pattern unclear. Press harder.")

        # 3. Minutiae extraction
        minutiae = extract_minutiae(image)
        if len(minutiae) < self.MIN_MINUTIAE_COUNT:
            raise LowQualityError(
                f"Insufficient minutiae points ({len(minutiae)}/{self.MIN_MINUTIAE_COUNT}). "
                "Ensure finger is dry and centered."
            )

        # 4. NFIQ2 score (NIST Fingerprint Image Quality)
        nfiq_score = compute_nfiq2_score(image)
        if nfiq_score < self.MIN_QUALITY_SCORE:
            raise LowQualityError(f"Quality score too low: {nfiq_score}/100")

        return QualityScore(
            nfiq2=nfiq_score,
            minutiae_count=len(minutiae),
            ridge_clarity=ridge_flow.clarity,
            overall="ACCEPTABLE"
        )

    def validate_enrollment(self, fingerprints: List[np.ndarray]) -> bool:
        """Validate complete enrollment."""

        if len(fingerprints) < self.MIN_FINGERPRINTS:
            raise InsufficientBiometricsError(
                f"Passport-level identity requires {self.MIN_FINGERPRINTS}+ fingerprints. "
                f"Provided: {len(fingerprints)}"
            )

        # Validate each fingerprint
        for i, fp in enumerate(fingerprints):
            quality = self.validate_fingerprint(fp)
            logger.info(f"Fingerprint {i}: Quality={quality.nfiq2}/100 ✓")

        return True
```

### Trusted Enrollment Centers (Optional)

**Purpose**: Government/authority-verified enrollment for legal identity.

```
Standard Enrollment (Self-Service):
  User → Scan fingerprints at home
       → Generate DID
       → Submit to blockchain
  Assurance Level: Medium (Self-Attested)
  Use Cases: Social media, voting, airdrops

Trusted Enrollment (Official):
  User → Visit enrollment center
       → Staff verifies passport/ID
       → Scan fingerprints on certified device
       → Staff signs enrollment transaction
       → Submit to blockchain with official endorsement
  Assurance Level: High (Government-Backed)
  Use Cases: Passport, driver's license, KYC/AML

Certification:
{
  "did": "did:cardano:mainnet:zQmXyZ...",
  "enrollment": {
    "date": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z",
    "location": "National ID Office, Oslo",
    "certifier": "did:cardano:mainnet:gov-norway",
    "certifierSignature": "0xabcdef...",
    "documentVerified": "Passport NO12345678",
    "assuranceLevel": "HIGH"
  }
}
```

**Examples of Trusted Certifiers**:
- Government ID agencies
- Banks (KYC/AML)
- Notaries
- Universities (student ID)
- Employers (employee ID)

---

## Cryptographic Guarantees

### One-Way Biometric Commitment

**Property**: Cannot reconstruct fingerprints from commitment.

```
Forward (Easy):
  Fingerprints → Fuzzy Commitment → DID
  [Biometric] → [Hash + Error Correction] → [BLAKE2b]

Reverse (IMPOSSIBLE):
  DID → ??? → Fingerprints
  [BLAKE2b] → [Cannot invert hash] → [UNKNOWN]

Security:
- Even if attacker steals DID and helper data
- Cannot recreate your fingerprints
- Must have actual fingers to authenticate ✅
```

### Helper Data Security

**Property**: Helper data is useless without fingerprints.

```
Helper Data Components:
1. Error-correcting code syndrome
2. Alignment parameters
3. Template positions

Attacker with helper data can:
  ❌ Reconstruct fingerprints (impossible)
  ❌ Authenticate without fingerprints (impossible)
  ❌ Create fake fingerprints (statistically impossible)

Attacker needs BOTH:
  ✅ Helper data (stored on blockchain)
  ✅ Actual fingerprints (only on your fingers)

Result: Helper data can be public ✅
```

### Zero-Knowledge Verification (Phase 6)

**Property**: Prove ownership without revealing fingerprints.

```
Standard Verification (Current):
  Prover: "Here are my fingerprints" → Sends biometric data
  Verifier: Checks fingerprints → Sees biometric data ❌

Zero-Knowledge Verification (Phase 6):
  Prover: "I know the fingerprints that match this DID"
  Prover: Generates ZK proof (no biometric data sent)
  Verifier: Verifies proof → Learns nothing about fingerprints ✅

Benefits:
- Privacy-preserving
- Cannot replay proof (includes nonce)
- Cannot learn biometric features
- Compliant with GDPR Article 9
```

---

## Revocation & Recovery

### Revocation List (Phase 4.6)

**Purpose**: Mark DIDs as compromised/invalid.

```json
{
  "revocationList": {
    "id": "did:cardano:mainnet:revocation-list-2025",
    "issuer": "did:cardano:mainnet:registry",
    "issued": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "revokedDIDs": [
      {
        "did": "did:cardano:mainnet:zQmCompromised...",
        "revokedDate": "2025-10-15T10:30:00Z",
        "reason": "BIOMETRIC_COMPROMISE",
        "signature": "0xabcdef..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Revocation Reasons**:
- `BIOMETRIC_COMPROMISE`: Fingerprints stolen/forged
- `WALLET_COMPROMISE`: All controller wallets compromised
- `USER_REQUEST`: User requests revocation
- `LEGAL_ORDER`: Court order
- `DEATH`: Deceased individual
- `FRAUD`: Fraudulent enrollment detected

**Process**:
1. User reports compromise → Sign revocation request
2. Submit to blockchain with proof
3. DID marked as revoked (append-only)
4. Verifiers check revocation list before accepting
5. Cannot unrevoke (immutable)

### Recovery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Lost Wallet (RECOVERABLE ✅)

```
Problem: Alice loses wallet with private keys
Solution:
  1. Re-scan fingerprints on new device
  2. System generates same DID (deterministic)
  3. System finds existing DID on blockchain
  4. Alice proves biometric ownership
  5. Add new wallet as controller
  6. Remove lost wallet from controller list
  7. DID recovered ✅

Time: 5-10 minutes
Requirements: Original fingerprints
```

#### Scenario 2: Compromised Wallet (RECOVERABLE ✅)

```
Problem: Attacker steals wallet private key
Solution:
  1. Use backup wallet to sign removal transaction
  2. Remove compromised wallet from controller list
  3. Add new wallet as controller
  4. Attacker loses access ✅

Time: Immediate
Requirements: At least one uncompromised controller wallet
```

#### Scenario 3: Biometric Compromise (NOT RECOVERABLE ❌)

```
Problem: Attacker gets Alice's fingerprints (mold, high-res photo)
Solution:
  1. CANNOT RECOVER - Fingerprints cannot be changed
  2. Must revoke DID permanently
  3. Create new DID with different biometric (e.g., face + voice)
  4. Revoked DID remains in history (for legal/audit purposes)

Time: Permanent
Prevention: Liveness detection, secure enrollment
```

#### Scenario 4: All Wallets Lost (RECOVERABLE via Trusted Service ⚠️)

```
Problem: Alice loses all wallet keys
Solution Option 1: Biometric Recovery (requires implementation)
  1. Visit trusted enrollment center
  2. Re-scan fingerprints on certified device
  3. Prove identity with passport/ID
  4. Staff signs recovery transaction
  5. New wallet added as controller
  6. DID recovered ✅

Solution Option 2: Social Recovery (M-of-N)
  1. Alice pre-designated 5 trusted contacts
  2. Requires 3/5 signatures to recover
  3. Contacts verify Alice's identity
  4. Sign recovery transaction
  5. New wallet added as controller
  6. DID recovered ✅

Time: Hours to days
Requirements: Pre-established recovery mechanism
```
