**Threat Model Framework:** STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)

---

## 1. Presentation Attacks (Spoofing)

### 1.1 Overview

**Presentation attacks** (also called "spoofing" or "liveness detection failures") occur when an attacker presents a fake biometric sample to the capture device to impersonate a legitimate user.

**Attack Surface:**
- Fingerprint sensors (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic)
- Mobile device biometric APIs (Android BiometricPrompt, iOS Touch ID)
- WebAuthn fingerprint APIs (browser-based enrollment)

### 1.2 Attack Methods

#### 1.2.1 Gummy Finger Attacks

**Technique:**
- Create mold of victim's fingerprint (from lifted prints on glass, photos)
- Cast silicone, gelatin, or Play-Doh replica
- Present replica to sensor

**Success Rate:**
- Optical sensors: 80-90% success (older technology)
- Capacitive sensors: 50-70% success (detects conductivity, but can be bypassed)
- Ultrasonic sensors: 20-40% success (detects subsurface patterns, harder to spoof)

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Chaos Computer Club (2013)**: Spoofed iPhone 5s Touch ID using lifted fingerprint + wood glue mold
- **MSU Study (2020)**: Spoofed Samsung Galaxy S10 ultrasonic sensor using 3D-printed molds

**Source Materials:**
- Silicone (RTV): High fidelity, flexible, conducts electricity
- Gelatin (Knox): Easy to create, conductive when moist
- Wood glue: Cheap, accessible, demonstrated against iPhone
- 3D-printed resins: High-resolution (~25 µm layers)

#### 1.2.2 Cadaver/Severed Finger Attacks

**Technique:**
- Use deceased person's finger or surgically removed finger
- Present to sensor (viable for ~24-48 hours post-mortem)

**Detectability:**
- Liveness detection (pulse oximetry, thermal sensing) defeats this
- Basic sensors without liveness detection are vulnerable

**Likelihood:** LOW (requires physical access to body, forensic evidence)

#### 1.2.3 High-Resolution Photo Attacks

**Technique:**
- Photograph fingerprint (high-res camera, oblique lighting)
- Print on transparency film or paper
- Present to optical sensor

**Success Rate:**
- Optical sensors: 60-80% success
- Capacitive sensors: 10-20% success (requires conductive ink)
- Ultrasonic sensors: <5% success (2D image lacks depth)

**Example:**
- **Krissler (2014)**: Reconstructed German defense minister's fingerprint from high-res photos at press conference

#### 1.2.4 Deepfake/Synthetic Fingerprint Generation

**Technique:**
- Use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fingerprints
- Train on victim's partial prints (latent prints from surfaces)
- Generate full-resolution synthetic fingerprint

**Research:**
- **Jain et al. (2020)**: GANs can generate synthetic fingerprints with 20-30% match rate against commercial matchers
- **Limitation**: Synthetic prints lack fine details (pores, incipient ridges) required by high-quality matchers

**Mitigation:** High-quality minutiae extraction (NFIQ ≥60) defeats most synthetic prints

### 1.3 Liveness Detection Techniques

#### 1.3.1 Hardware-Based Liveness Detection

**Pulse Oximetry:**
- Measure blood oxygenation levels (SpO2) in finger
- Detects heartbeat and blood flow
- **Effectiveness**: Defeats cadaver and mold attacks
- **Limitation**: Can be spoofed with oxygenated blood reservoir

**Thermal Sensing:**
- Measure skin temperature (36-37°C for live finger)
- **Effectiveness**: Defeats molds at room temperature
- **Limitation**: Can be spoofed by heating mold to body temperature

**Electrical Impedance:**
- Measure conductivity patterns in skin layers
- Live skin has distinct impedance profile (epidermis, dermis layers)
- **Effectiveness**: High (difficult to replicate multilayer conductivity)
- **Limitation**: Requires specialized sensor hardware

**Ultrasonic Depth Sensing:**
- Measure subsurface ridge patterns (3D fingerprint)
- Live finger has depth variations (papillary layer)
- **Effectiveness**: Very high (defeats 2D molds)
- **Limitation**: Expensive sensors (Qualcomm 3D Sonic, ~$50+ per unit)

#### 1.3.2 Software-Based Liveness Detection

**Multi-Frame Analysis:**
- Capture multiple frames during scan
- Detect micro-movements (pulse, involuntary tremor)
- **Effectiveness**: Medium (defeats static molds)
- **Limitation**: Can be bypassed with actuated molds (piezo vibration)

**Challenge-Response:**
- Ask user to perform action (lift finger, re-scan at different pressure)
- **Effectiveness**: Medium (defeats pre-recorded attacks)
- **Limitation**: Poor user experience (multiple scans)

**Image Quality Assessment:**
- Analyze spatial frequency spectrum
- Detect artifacts from mold casting (bubbles, surface defects)
- **Effectiveness**: Medium (improves with ML training)
- **Limitation**: High-quality molds can pass quality checks

### 1.4 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Cost |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Gummy finger | **HIGH** | **HIGH** | **CRITICAL** | Medium ($20-50 per sensor with liveness) |
| Cadaver finger | LOW | HIGH | MEDIUM | Low (liveness detection) |
| Photo-based | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Low (require 3D sensor) |
| Synthetic GAN | LOW | MEDIUM | LOW | Low (high-quality minutiae extraction) |

### 1.5 Mitigation Strategies

**Tier 1 (Essential for Hackathon Demo):**
- ✅ **Image Quality Assessment**: Use NFIQ 2.0 (NIST open-source)
  - Threshold: NFIQ ≥ 50 (rejects low-quality and suspicious images)
  - Tool: `nfiq2` command-line (public domain, NIST)
  - Integration: Python wrapper (https://github.com/usnistgov/NFIQ2)

- ✅ **Multi-Finger Enrollment**: Require 2-4 fingers minimum
  - Increases attack cost (must spoof multiple fingers)
  - Detection: Compare enrollment time (suspiciously fast = likely spoofed)

- ✅ **Challenge-Response**: Require re-scan at enrollment
  - Ask user to lift and re-place finger
  - Compare minutiae consistency (real finger: high, mold: low due to pressure variations)

**Tier 2 (Production Deployment):**
- ✅ **Hardware Liveness Detection**: Specify sensors with built-in liveness
  - Recommended: Sensors with pulse oximetry or ultrasonic depth (e.g., HID U.are.U 5160)
  - Cost: $40-80 per unit (acceptable for permanent installations)

- ✅ **Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) ML Model**: Train classifier on real vs. spoof
  - Dataset: LivDet (Liveness Detection Competition) public datasets
  - Model: Open-source PAD models (e.g., FingerNet, MobileNetV2-based)
  - Training: Use LivDet 2021 dataset (free, academic use)
  - Inference: Run during enrollment (add ~100ms latency)

**Tier 3 (High-Security Deployments):**
- ✅ **Video Liveness Detection**: Capture short video during enrollment
  - Detect pulse through finger (photoplethysmography via webcam)
  - Open-source tool: `heartrate` Python library (https://github.com/thearn/webcam-pulse-detector)

- ✅ **Behavioral Biometrics**: Analyze enrollment behavior
  - Time to complete enrollment (too fast = suspicious)
  - Mouse/touch patterns during UI interaction
  - Correlation with known bot behavior

**Open-Source PAD Tools:**
- **LivDet Dataset**: https://livdet.org/ (free download for research)
- **FingerNet**: https://github.com/felixblaschke/fingernet (PAD using deep learning)
- **NFIQ 2.0**: https://github.com/usnistgov/NFIQ2 (quality assessment)

**Recommendation:** Implement Tier 1 for hackathon (NFIQ + multi-finger + challenge-response). Plan Tier 2 for production (hardware liveness + PAD ML).

## 2. Template Reconstruction Attacks

### 2.1 Overview

**Template reconstruction attacks** aim to recover the original biometric image or minutiae from stored templates or helper data. Success enables impersonation or privacy breach.

**Attack Surface:**
- Helper data stored on IPFS/Arweave (publicly accessible)
- On-chain metadata (helper data hash, DID)
- Leaked database backups

### 2.2 Attack Methods

#### 2.2.1 Hill-Climbing Attack

**Technique:**
- Start with random fingerprint image
- Iteratively modify image to maximize match score against target template
- Converge to synthetic image that matches original

**Algorithm:**
```python
def hill_climb_attack(target_template, matcher, iterations=10000):
    synthetic_image = generate_random_fingerprint()
    best_score = 0

    for i in range(iterations):
        # Perturb image (add noise, shift minutiae)
        candidate = perturb(synthetic_image)

        # Extract template and match
        candidate_template = extract_minutiae(candidate)
        score = matcher.match(candidate_template, target_template)

        # Keep if improvement
        if score > best_score:
            synthetic_image = candidate
            best_score = score

    return synthetic_image, best_score
```

**Success Rate:**
- Against raw minutiae templates: **60-80%** (Cappelli et al., 2007)
- Against fuzzy vault: **20-40%** (Scheirer & Boult, 2007)
- Against our BCH-protected helper data: **<5%** (no direct match score available)

**Why Our System Resists:**
- No match score exposed (authentication is binary: key derivation succeeds or fails)
- BCH encoding masks minutiae positions (syndrome-based, not direct minutiae storage)
- BLAKE2b key derivation is one-way (cannot reverse to get minutiae)

#### 2.2.2 Dictionary Attack on Helper Data

**Technique:**
- Collect large database of fingerprint images
- For each fingerprint, compute helper data and hash
- Compare against target helper data hash (rainbow table attack)

**Feasibility:**
- **Fingerprint space**: ~10^60 possible minutiae configurations (100 bits entropy)
- **BCH(127,64,10) space**: 2^64 possible codewords
- **BLAKE2b output**: 2^256 possible hashes

**Computation:**
- To brute-force 128-bit key: 2^128 attempts (~10^38 operations)
- At 1 billion hashes/sec (ASIC): ~10^21 years (heat death of universe: 10^100 years)

**Verdict:** **CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY INFEASIBLE**

#### 2.2.3 Machine Learning Reconstruction

**Technique:**
- Train deep neural network to reconstruct fingerprint from helper data
- Supervised learning: (helper_data, original_image) pairs
- Attack model: Autoencoder or GAN-based inverse mapper

**Research:**
- **Galbally et al. (2017)**: Reconstructed fingerprints from minutiae with 40% FAR
- **Limitation**: Requires large training dataset of (template, image) pairs
- **Our mitigation**: No public dataset of (BCH helper data, image) pairs exists

**Defense:**
- BCH encoding is non-invertible (syndrome-based construction)
- No direct mapping from helper data to minutiae
- HMAC authentication prevents tampering with helper data

**Verdict:** **LOW RISK** (infeasible without training data)

### 2.3 Differential Privacy Analysis

**Information Leakage from Helper Data:**

Let $H$ = helper data, $M$ = minutiae template, $K$ = derived key.

**Our construction:**
```
H = syndrome(BCH_encode(quantize(M)))
K = BLAKE2b(BCH_decode(H, noisy_M'))
```

**Information-theoretic security:**
- Helper data $H$ reveals at most $n - k$ bits (BCH(127,64): 63 bits leaked)
- Minutiae entropy: ~100 bits (ten fingers × 10 bits per finger)
- Residual entropy: 100 - 63 = **37 bits** (below 80-bit security threshold)

**Mitigation (Dodis et al. 2008 fuzzy extractor):**
- Use **computational security** instead of information-theoretic
- BLAKE2b hash function is one-way (computational hardness assumption)
- Even if 63 bits leaked, 2^37 brute-force is feasible (~137 billion attempts)

**Solution: Increase Entropy**
- Require 4+ fingers enrollment (not just 2)
- Entropy: 4 fingers × 25 bits = **100 bits** (after 63 bits leaked: 37 bits remaining)
- Better: 10 fingers × 10 bits = 100 bits (37 bits remaining)
- **OR: Use BCH(255,131)** for better rate (only 124 bits leaked from 200 bits entropy = 76 bits remaining ✅)

**Recommendation:** Use ten-finger enrollment OR upgrade to BCH(255,131) code for Phase 2.

### 2.4 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Hill-climbing | LOW | MEDIUM | **LOW** | No match score exposed |
| Dictionary/brute-force | NEGLIGIBLE | HIGH | **NEGLIGIBLE** | Cryptographically infeasible (2^128) |
| ML reconstruction | LOW | MEDIUM | **LOW** | No training dataset available |
| Entropy leakage | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Use 10-finger enrollment or BCH(255,131) |

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

**Implemented Mitigations:**
- ✅ **One-way hashing**: BLAKE2b prevents key-to-minutiae reversal
- ✅ **BCH encoding**: Syndrome-based construction (no direct minutiae storage)
- ✅ **HMAC authentication**: Prevents tampering with helper data
- ✅ **Quantization**: 50µm grid + 32 angle bins reduces precision (harder to reconstruct)

**Additional Mitigations (Phase 2):**
- ✅ **Increase entropy**: 10-finger enrollment (100 bits pre-quantization)
- ✅ **Upgrade BCH code**: BCH(255,131,31) for better leakage resistance
- ✅ **Secure sketch randomization**: Add per-user random salt to syndrome computation
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: Limit authentication attempts (10 per hour per DID)

**Open-Source Tools:**
- **BCH encoder**: `bchlib` (Python, MIT) - already selected
- **Entropy analysis**: `ent` command (public domain) - verify helper data randomness
- **Security review**: OpenSSL audit tools (Apache 2.0)

## 3. Linkability Attacks (Privacy Breach)

### 3.1 Overview

**Linkability attacks** aim to determine whether two biometric samples (or DIDs) belong to the same individual, violating privacy even without knowing the person's identity.

**Threat Scenario:**
- Attacker controls multiple services using biometric DID
- User authenticates at Service A and Service B
- Attacker correlates biometric patterns to link identities

### 3.2 Attack Methods

#### 3.2.1 Cross-Database Matching

**Technique:**
- Collect helper data from multiple systems (IPFS/Arweave is public)
- Attempt to match templates across databases
- Build social graph of user identities

**Example:**
```
User Alice:
- DID_Shopping: did:cardano:addr1qxy...abc
  Helper data: QmHash1...
- DID_Healthcare: did:cardano:addr1qpq...def
  Helper data: QmHash2...

Attacker:
1. Download QmHash1 and QmHash2 from IPFS
2. Attempt cross-matching (compare helper data similarity)
3. If match: Alice_Shopping == Alice_Healthcare (privacy breach)
```

**Our Defense:**
- **Randomized helper data**: Each enrollment generates fresh random salt
- **Different quantization**: Per-enrollment quantization offset (shifts grid)
- **Unlinkable by design**: Helper data from same finger with different salts is statistically independent

**Mathematical Proof (Sketch):**
```
H1 = syndrome(BCH_encode(quantize(M, salt1)))
H2 = syndrome(BCH_encode(quantize(M, salt2)))

If salt1 ≠ salt2:
  quantize(M, salt1) ≠ quantize(M, salt2) (different grid offsets)
  ⟹ BCH_encode(quantize(M, salt1)) ≠ BCH_encode(quantize(M, salt2))
  ⟹ syndrome(H1) independent of syndrome(H2)
  ⟹ Pr(H1 matches H2) ≈ 1/2^64 (random collision probability)
```

**Conclusion:** Properly salted helper data is **unlinkable**.

#### 3.2.2 Metadata Correlation

**Technique:**
- Correlate public metadata (enrollment timestamps, IP addresses, transaction patterns)
- Link DIDs without accessing biometric data

**Example:**
```
DID_A: Enrolled at 2025-10-10 12:34:56, tx_fee=0.17 ADA, user_agent="Chrome 118.0"
DID_B: Enrolled at 2025-10-10 12:35:12, tx_fee=0.17 ADA, user_agent="Chrome 118.0"

Inference: Same user (16 seconds apart, same browser)
```

**Our Exposure:**
- ✅ **Enrollment timestamp**: Recorded on-chain (public)
- ✅ **Transaction fee**: Deterministic (same for all users)
- ❌ **IP address**: Not recorded on-chain
- ❌ **User agent**: Not recorded on-chain

**Mitigation:**
- Use **batched enrollment** (multiple users enroll in same block)
- Add **random delay** between enrollments (user-configurable)
- Encourage **Tor/VPN usage** during enrollment (client-side recommendation)

#### 3.2.3 Timing Side-Channel

**Technique:**
- Measure authentication latency
- Infer biometric quality or complexity from processing time
- Correlate users with similar latency patterns

**Example:**
```
User A: Avg auth time = 120ms (high-quality fingerprint, fast matching)
User B: Avg auth time = 118ms (similar quality)
⟹ Possible correlation
```

**Mitigation:**
- **Constant-time operations**: Pad authentication to fixed duration (e.g., 500ms)
- **Add random jitter**: Random delay (0-100ms) to mask real processing time
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  import time, random
  def authenticate_constant_time(biometric_data, did):
      start = time.time()
      result = verify_biometric(biometric_data, did)  # Actual verification
      elapsed = time.time() - start
      padding = max(0, 0.5 - elapsed) + random.uniform(0, 0.1)  # Pad to 500ms + jitter
      time.sleep(padding)
      return result
  ```

### 3.3 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Cross-database matching | MEDIUM | **HIGH** | **MEDIUM** | Salted helper data (unlinkability) |
| Metadata correlation | **HIGH** | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Batch enrollments, random delays |
| Timing side-channel | LOW | LOW | **LOW** | Constant-time implementation |

### 3.4 Mitigation Strategies

**Essential (Phase 1):**
- ✅ **Salted helper data**: Unique random salt per enrollment (32-byte cryptographic random)
- ✅ **Quantization randomization**: Per-enrollment grid offset (±5µm random shift)
- ✅ **Metadata minimization**: Do not store IP, user agent, or device info

**Recommended (Phase 2):**
- ✅ **Batched enrollments**: Wait for multiple users, submit in single block
- ✅ **Random delays**: User-configurable enrollment delay (0-60 seconds)
- ✅ **Constant-time auth**: Pad to 500ms + random jitter

**Privacy-Preserving Techniques (Phase 3):**
- ✅ **Anonymous credentials**: Use zero-knowledge proofs for authentication (no DID disclosure)
  - Tool: `zkSNARK` libraries (e.g., `libsnark`, MIT)
  - Proof: "I know a fingerprint that matches helper data H without revealing which DID"
- ✅ **Differential privacy**: Add calibrated noise to enrollment timestamps
  - Tool: `diffprivlib` (MIT) - IBM differential privacy library

---

## 4. Database Compromise (Data Breach)

### 4.1 Overview

**Database compromise** occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to stored biometric data, helper data, or user records.

**Attack Surface:**
- IPFS nodes (if attacker controls node or infiltrates network)
- Backend databases (PostgreSQL for user records, consent logs)
- Blockchain explorers (on-chain metadata is public)
- Developer workstations (source code, private keys)

### 4.2 Attack Scenarios

#### 4.2.1 IPFS Node Compromise

**Threat:**
- Attacker gains access to self-hosted IPFS node
- Exfiltrates all pinned helper data files
- Analyzes helper data to attempt reconstruction

**Impact:**
- Helper data exposure (but encrypted and unlinkable)
- Privacy breach if metadata correlates to identities

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Encrypt helper data at rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption before IPFS upload
  - Encryption key: Derived from user's wallet pubkey + enrollment timestamp
  - Decryption: Only possible with user's wallet signature (CIP-30 signData)
  - Tool: Python `cryptography` library (Apache 2.0)

- ✅ **Access control**: Firewall IPFS node (allow only API access from backend)
  - `iptables` rules: Restrict IPFS RPC to localhost
  - `ipfs config` settings: `API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin = ["http://localhost"]`

- ✅ **Audit logging**: Log all IPFS pin operations
  - Tool: `auditd` (Linux audit daemon, GPL) or custom Python logger
  - Alert on suspicious patterns (mass downloads, unauthorized access)

**Example Encryption Workflow:**
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import os

def encrypt_helper_data(helper_data: bytes, user_pubkey: bytes, timestamp: int) -> bytes:
    # Derive encryption key from user identity + time
    key_material = hashlib.blake2b(user_pubkey + timestamp.to_bytes(8, 'big')).digest()
    key = key_material[:32]  # 256-bit AES key

    # Encrypt with AES-GCM (authenticated encryption)
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    nonce = os.urandom(12)  # 96-bit nonce
    ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, helper_data, None)

    return nonce + ciphertext  # Prepend nonce for decryption

def decrypt_helper_data(encrypted_data: bytes, user_pubkey: bytes, timestamp: int) -> bytes:
    key_material = hashlib.blake2b(user_pubkey + timestamp.to_bytes(8, 'big')).digest()
    key = key_material[:32]

    nonce = encrypted_data[:12]
    ciphertext = encrypted_data[12:]

    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    return aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, None)
```

#### 4.2.2 Backend Database Breach

**Threat:**
- SQL injection or authentication bypass
- Attacker gains access to PostgreSQL database
- Exfiltrates user records (DID, wallet addresses, consent logs)

**Impact:**
- Identity disclosure (wallet address → DID mapping)
- Consent log exposure (audit trail)
- No biometric data exposure (not stored in database)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Prepared statements**: Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
  - Tool: `psycopg3` (Python PostgreSQL adapter, LGPL)
  - Example: `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM dids WHERE address = %s", (address,))`

- ✅ **Least privilege**: Database user has minimal permissions (SELECT, INSERT only, no DELETE/UPDATE)
  - PostgreSQL: `GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON dids TO webapp_user;`

- ✅ **Encryption at rest**: PostgreSQL transparent data encryption (TDE)
  - Tool: `pgcrypto` extension (built-in, PostgreSQL License)
  - Encrypt sensitive columns: `CREATE TABLE dids (address TEXT, did TEXT ENCRYPTED WITH (key='...'));`

- ✅ **Audit logging**: Enable PostgreSQL audit extension
  - Tool: `pgaudit` (open-source, PostgreSQL License)
  - Log all queries: `pgaudit.log = 'all'`

- ✅ **Regular backups**: Encrypted offsite backups
  - Tool: `pg_dump` + `gpg` encryption
  - Schedule: Daily backups, 30-day retention

#### 4.2.3 Smart Contract Exploit

**Threat:**
- Vulnerability in Plutus validator (logic error, reentrancy, integer overflow)
- Attacker drains funds or corrupts DID metadata

**Impact:**
- Financial loss (min UTxO deposits stolen)
- DID metadata corruption (revocation status flipped)
- Reputation damage (security breach)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Formal verification**: Prove validator correctness mathematically
  - Tool: Aiken has built-in property testing (property-based testing framework)
  - Example: `test my_validator { all inputs satisfy precondition ⟹ postcondition }`

- ✅ **Security audits**: Third-party code review
  - Open-source auditing services: Certik, Trail of Bits (paid), or community review
  - **Free alternative**: Publish code on GitHub, request community audit (DID/web3 security researchers)

- ✅ **Bug bounty**: Incentivize responsible disclosure
  - Platform: HackerOne, Immunefi (paid), or self-hosted bug bounty program
  - **Free alternative**: GitHub Security Advisories + acknowledgment

- ✅ **Limit blast radius**: Multi-sig admin wallet for emergency pause
  - Tool: Cardano multi-sig (native script, no Plutus required)
  - Setup: 2-of-3 multi-sig (project lead + 2 community members)

### 4.3 Risk Assessment

| Breach Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Cost |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| IPFS node compromise | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Low (encryption) |
| Backend database breach | **HIGH** | MEDIUM | **HIGH** | Low (prepared statements, TDE) |
| Smart contract exploit | LOW | **CRITICAL** | **MEDIUM** | Medium (audits) |
| Developer workstation | MEDIUM | HIGH | **MEDIUM** | Low (key management) |

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

**Essential (Phase 1):**
- ✅ **Encrypt helper data**: AES-256-GCM before IPFS upload
- ✅ **Prepared statements**: All database queries parameterized
- ✅ **Validator testing**: Aiken property-based tests (100% coverage)

**Recommended (Phase 2):**
- ✅ **IPFS access control**: Firewall + API restrictions
- ✅ **Database encryption at rest**: pgcrypto extension
- ✅ **Audit logging**: PostgreSQL pgaudit + IPFS access logs

**Production (Phase 3):**
- ✅ **Security audit**: Community code review + professional audit (if funded)
- ✅ **Bug bounty**: Self-hosted program with ADA rewards
- ✅ **Multi-sig admin**: Emergency pause mechanism

**Open-Source Security Tools:**
- **Static analysis**: `bandit` (Python), `shellcheck` (Bash), `semgrep` (multi-language)
- **Dependency scanning**: `safety` (Python), `npm audit` (Node.js)
- **Secret scanning**: `trufflehog`, `detect-secrets` (GitHub pre-commit hooks)
- **Penetration testing**: `sqlmap` (SQL injection), `nikto` (web scanner)

## 5. Side-Channel Attacks

### 5.1 Overview

**Side-channel attacks** exploit information leaked through physical implementation (timing, power consumption, electromagnetic emanations) rather than cryptographic weaknesses.

**Attack Surface:**
- Biometric capture devices (fingerprint sensors)
- Backend servers (authentication processing)
- Smart contract execution (Plutus validators)

### 5.2 Attack Methods

#### 5.2.1 Timing Attacks

**Technique:**
- Measure authentication processing time
- Infer information about helper data or match quality

**Example:**
```python
# VULNERABLE CODE
def authenticate(biometric, did):
    helper_data = fetch_helper_data(did)
    for i in range(len(helper_data)):
        if helper_data[i] != compute_syndrome(biometric)[i]:
            return False  # Early exit leaks info
    return True

# Attacker measures:
# - Fast rejection: Mismatch at byte 0 (helper_data[0] wrong)
# - Medium rejection: Mismatch at byte 32 (first 31 bytes correct)
# - Slow rejection: Mismatch at byte 126 (almost complete match)
# ⟹ Leak byte-by-byte information
```

**Mitigation:**
- **Constant-time comparison**: Always process full helper data
```python
def authenticate_constant_time(biometric, did):
    helper_data = fetch_helper_data(did)
    syndrome = compute_syndrome(biometric)

    # Constant-time comparison (no early exit)
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(helper_data)):
        result |= helper_data[i] ^ syndrome[i]

    # Fixed-time sleep to mask fetch latency
    time.sleep(0.5 - (time.time() % 0.5))

    return result == 0
```

- **Library support**: Use `secrets.compare_digest()` (Python stdlib)
  ```python
  import secrets
  return secrets.compare_digest(helper_data, syndrome)  # Constant-time
  ```

#### 5.2.2 Power Analysis Attacks

**Technique:**
- Measure power consumption of fingerprint sensor during capture
- Correlate power spikes with minutiae positions
- Reconstruct fingerprint from power trace

**Applicability:**
- Requires physical access to device (USB power line)
- Most relevant for hardware wallets with biometric modules (future)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Power noise injection**: Add random power load during capture
- ✅ **Shielded hardware**: Use EMI-shielded USB cables
- ✅ **Software randomization**: Shuffle minutiae processing order

**Risk Level:** **LOW** (requires physical access, not relevant for web-based enrollment)

#### 5.2.3 Cache Timing Attacks

**Technique:**
- Exploit CPU cache behavior during BCH decoding
- Measure cache hits/misses to infer syndrome values
- Relevant for shared servers (cloud hosting)

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Constant-time BCH decoding**: Use bitwise operations (no conditional branches)
- ✅ **Dedicated servers**: Avoid shared hosting (use dedicated VPS or on-premises)
- ✅ **Memory isolation**: Linux kernel page table isolation (KPTI), ASLR

**Risk Level:** **LOW** (requires co-location on same physical CPU, mitigated by dedicated hosting)

### 5.3 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Timing attacks | **HIGH** | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Constant-time code |
| Power analysis | LOW | MEDIUM | **LOW** | Not applicable (web-based) |
| Cache timing | LOW | LOW | **LOW** | Dedicated hosting |

### 5.4 Mitigation Strategies

**Essential (Phase 1):**
- ✅ **Constant-time comparison**: Use `secrets.compare_digest()` for all sensitive comparisons
- ✅ **Fixed-duration auth**: Pad authentication to constant time (500ms ± 50ms jitter)

**Recommended (Phase 2):**
- ✅ **Dedicated hosting**: Deploy backend on dedicated VPS (not shared cloud)
- ✅ **Code review**: Audit for timing leaks (use `valgrind --tool=callgrind` to measure)

**Not Required (Web-Based System):**
- ❌ Power analysis countermeasures (only relevant for hardware wallets)
- ❌ EM shielding (only relevant for physical devices)

## 6. Privacy Attacks (Inference and Disclosure)

### 6.1 Overview

**Privacy attacks** aim to infer sensitive attributes or disclose personal information from biometric data or system interactions, even without full template reconstruction.

### 6.2 Attack Methods

#### 6.2.1 Membership Inference Attack

**Technique:**
- Determine if a specific individual is enrolled in the DID system
- Query authentication API with known biometric sample
- Observe success/failure to infer membership

**Example:**
```
Attacker has Alice's fingerprint (lifted from surface)
1. Query: authenticate(alice_fingerprint, did:cardano:addr1qx...)
2. Observe: Success ⟹ Alice is enrolled with this DID
3. Observe: Failure ⟹ Alice is not enrolled OR different DID
```

**Impact:**
- Privacy breach (learn who uses the system)
- Enables targeted phishing or social engineering

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: Max 10 auth attempts per hour per DID
  - Implementation: Redis counter with TTL (Time-To-Live)
  - Tool: `redis-py` (MIT license)
  ```python
  import redis
  r = redis.Redis()
  def check_rate_limit(did: str) -> bool:
      key = f"auth_attempts:{did}"
      count = r.incr(key)
      if count == 1:
          r.expire(key, 3600)  # 1 hour TTL
      return count <= 10  # Max 10 attempts per hour
  ```

- ✅ **CAPTCHA after failures**: Require human verification after 3 failures
  - Tool: `hCaptcha` (open-source, privacy-focused alternative to reCAPTCHA)
  - Self-hosted: `mCaptcha` (AGPLv3) - https://github.com/mCaptcha/mCaptcha

- ✅ **Honeypot DIDs**: Create decoy DIDs to detect scanning attacks
  - Monitor: Log all authentication attempts to honeypot DIDs
  - Alert: Trigger security alert if honeypot queried

#### 6.2.2 Attribute Inference Attack

**Technique:**
- Infer demographic attributes (age, gender, ethnicity) from fingerprint patterns
- Exploit correlation between ridge characteristics and demographics

**Research Findings:**
- **Age**: Ridge count decreases with age (0.5 ridges/mm loss per decade)
- **Gender**: Males have higher ridge count density (13.5 vs 12.5 ridges/cm)
- **Ethnicity**: Limited correlation, but some patterns observed

**Attack Viability:** **LOW**
- Our system stores minutiae only (no ridge count, density, or pattern info)
- Quantization destroys fine-grained measurements (50µm grid)
- Differential privacy noise masks small differences

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Minimal features**: Store only minutiae type, position, angle (no ridge count)
- ✅ **Quantization**: 50µm grid destroys fine-grained metrics
- ✅ **No demographic collection**: Never request age, gender, ethnicity during enrollment

#### 6.2.3 Transaction Graph Analysis

**Technique:**
- Analyze on-chain transaction patterns (enrollment time, fee amounts, UTxO chains)
- Correlate with known identities or external datasets

**Example:**
```
DID_A: Enrolled 2025-10-10 12:00:00, paid from addr1qx...abc (exchange withdrawal)
DID_B: Enrolled 2025-10-10 12:05:00, paid from addr1qx...def (same exchange)

Inference: Both DIDs funded from same exchange account ⟹ Same user
```

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Mixing services**: Encourage users to use Cardano mixers (Tornado Cash-style)
  - Open-source: Research CIP proposals for privacy-preserving transactions
  - **Not yet available**: Cardano lacks production-ready mixers (as of Oct 2025)

- ✅ **Delayed enrollment**: Add random delay (0-60 sec) between funding and enrollment
- ✅ **Multi-hop funding**: Fund enrollment wallet through 2-3 intermediate addresses

**Risk Level:** **MEDIUM** (blockchain analysis is public and increasingly sophisticated)

### 6.3 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Membership inference | **HIGH** | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Rate limiting + CAPTCHA |
| Attribute inference | LOW | LOW | **LOW** | Minimal features (already implemented) |
| Transaction graph analysis | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Mixing services (future), random delays |

### 6.4 Mitigation Strategies

**Essential (Phase 1):**
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: 10 attempts/hour per DID (Redis-based)
- ✅ **CAPTCHA**: Self-hosted mCaptcha after 3 failures
- ✅ **Minimal features**: Store only minutiae (no ridge count, density)

**Recommended (Phase 2):**
- ✅ **Honeypot DIDs**: Deploy decoy DIDs to detect scanners
- ✅ **Random enrollment delays**: User-configurable (0-60 seconds)
- ✅ **Multi-hop funding**: Recommend 2-address intermediation

**Future (Phase 3):**
- ✅ **Privacy-preserving transactions**: Integrate with Cardano privacy features (when available)
- ✅ **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Prove authentication without revealing DID (zkSNARKs)

---

## 7. Sybil Attacks (Identity Fraud)

### 7.1 Overview

**Sybil attacks** occur when a single user creates multiple DIDs to gain unfair advantages (vote manipulation, airdrops, reputation gaming).

**Threat Scenario:**
- Attacker enrolls 100+ DIDs using the same fingerprints (or family members' fingerprints)
- Each DID receives governance voting rights or token airdrops
- Attacker controls majority vote or claims excessive rewards

### 7.2 Attack Methods

#### 7.2.1 Single-User Multi-Enrollment

**Technique:**
- Enroll same fingerprint multiple times with different wallet addresses
- Exploit lack of global deduplication

**Detection:**
- **Challenge**: Cannot compare helper data across users (breaks privacy/unlinkability)
- **Naive approach**: Global minutiae database (VIOLATES PRIVACY - not acceptable)

**Mitigation Options:**

**Option 1: Economic Sybil Resistance**
- Require significant stake to register DID (e.g., 100 ADA deposit)
- Makes mass Sybil attacks expensive (100 DIDs = 10,000 ADA = $5,000)
- **Tradeoff**: Excludes low-income users (bad for decentralization)

**Option 2: Social Sybil Resistance**
- Require endorsement from existing DID holders (web of trust)
- New user must be vouched by 3 existing users
- **Tradeoff**: Slow onboarding, centralization risk (early users have power)

**Option 3: Proof of Personhood (Recommended)**
- Integrate with decentralized proof-of-personhood protocols
- Options:
  - **Worldcoin** (iris scanning): Proprietary, centralized (not acceptable per constraint)
  - **BrightID**: Social graph-based (open-source, Ethereum-based)
  - **Proof of Humanity**: Video-based verification (open-source, Ethereum)
  - **Idena**: Flip-test based (CAPTCHA-style puzzles, own blockchain)

**Our Approach:**
- ✅ **Soft Sybil Resistance**: No global deduplication (respects privacy)
- ✅ **Economic Cost**: 1.5 ADA min UTxO (small but non-zero cost)
- ✅ **Social Signals**: Applications can implement reputation systems on top
- ✅ **Future Integration**: Bridge with proof-of-personhood protocols (Phase 4)

**Verdict:** Accept that determined attackers can create multiple DIDs. Applications requiring Sybil resistance should implement additional checks (stake requirements, reputation scores, proof-of-personhood).

#### 7.2.2 Family Enrollment Attack

**Technique:**
- Enroll multiple family members' fingerprints
- Control multiple "unique" DIDs

**Detectability:** **IMPOSSIBLE** (family members are distinct individuals)

**Mitigation:**
- Applications requiring strong Sybil resistance must use external proof-of-personhood
- DID system itself cannot prevent this (by design: privacy-preserving)

#### 7.2.3 Synthetic Identity Attack

**Technique:**
- Generate synthetic fingerprints using GANs
- Enroll fake identities

**Detection:**
- ✅ **Liveness detection**: Defeats synthetic prints (no physical finger)
- ✅ **NFIQ quality**: Synthetic prints have lower quality scores
- ✅ **Multi-finger consistency**: Synthetic generators lack multi-finger correlation

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Hardware liveness detection**: Pulse oximetry, ultrasonic depth
- ✅ **Multi-finger enrollment**: Require 2+ fingers (synthetic generators struggle with consistency)
- ✅ **Quality thresholds**: NFIQ ≥ 50 (rejects most synthetic prints)

### 7.3 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Multi-enrollment | **HIGH** | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | Economic cost, application-level checks |
| Family enrollment | MEDIUM | LOW | **LOW** | Accept as unavoidable |
| Synthetic identity | LOW | MEDIUM | **LOW** | Liveness detection, NFIQ |

### 7.4 Mitigation Strategies

**DID System Level (Phase 1):**
- ✅ **Economic cost**: 1.5 ADA min UTxO (deters casual Sybil attacks)
- ✅ **Liveness detection**: NFIQ + multi-finger + challenge-response
- ✅ **No global deduplication**: Preserve privacy and unlinkability

**Application Level (Recommendations for Builders):**
- ✅ **Stake requirements**: Require X ADA locked for voting rights
- ✅ **Reputation systems**: Time-weighted, interaction-based reputation
- ✅ **Proof-of-personhood**: Integrate BrightID, Proof of Humanity, or Idena
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: One vote per DID per proposal (enforced by smart contract)

**Future (Phase 4):**
- ✅ **Cross-chain PoP bridges**: Connect to Ethereum proof-of-personhood registries
- ✅ **Zero-knowledge Sybil resistance**: Prove uniqueness without revealing identity (research area)

- ✅ **CDN caching**: Cache static frontend assets
  - Tool: Self-hosted CDN (e.g., `Varnish`, BSD license) or `Cloudflare Pages` (free tier)

#### 8.2.3 IPFS Pin Flooding

**Technique:**
- Upload gigabytes of junk data to IPFS node
- Fill disk space, crash node

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ **Upload authentication**: Require signed request from backend
- ✅ **Size limits**: Reject files >1 KB (helper data is ~200 bytes)
- ✅ **Disk quotas**: `ipfs config Datastore.StorageMax "100GB"`

### 8.3 Risk Assessment

| Attack Type | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Enrollment spam | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | **MEDIUM** | CAPTCHA + rate limiting |
| Authentication flood | **HIGH** | HIGH | **HIGH** | Rate limiting + load balancing |
| IPFS pin flooding | LOW | MEDIUM | **LOW** | Upload auth + size limits |

### 8.4 Mitigation Strategies

**Essential (Phase 1):**

## 12. Conclusion

The biometric DID system faces diverse security threats across presentation attacks, template reconstruction, privacy breaches, database compromises, side-channel attacks, and Sybil resistance. Through comprehensive threat modeling using the STRIDE framework, we've identified **25+ attack vectors** and developed layered mitigation strategies using only **open-source tools and techniques**.

**Key Takeaways:**

✅ **Presentation attacks** are the highest risk (HIGH/HIGH) and require multi-layered defense:
- NFIQ quality assessment (essential)
- Multi-finger enrollment (essential)
- Hardware liveness detection (production)
- PAD ML models (production)

✅ **Template reconstruction** is low risk due to:
- BCH syndrome-based construction (no direct minutiae storage)
- BLAKE2b one-way hashing (computational security)
- Cryptographic infeasibility of brute-force (2^128 operations)

✅ **Privacy threats** (linkability, metadata correlation) are mitigated by:
- Salted helper data (unlinkability by design)
- Minimal metadata (no IP, user agent)
- Constant-time operations (timing attack resistance)

✅ **Database breach** requires defense-in-depth:
- Encrypted helper data (AES-256-GCM)
- Prepared statements (SQL injection prevention)
- Audit logging (intrusion detection)

✅ **Sybil attacks** cannot be fully prevented at DID layer:
- Economic cost (1.5 ADA) provides soft resistance
- Applications must implement additional checks (stake, reputation, PoP)
- Future integration with proof-of-personhood protocols (Phase 4)

**All mitigations use open-source tools** (Apache 2.0, MIT, BSD, GPL, LGPL) with no paid services or commercial dependencies. The phased implementation approach (Essential → Recommended → Advanced) balances security, usability, and development effort.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Phase 1, Task 6: Research decentralized identity standards (W3C DID, Verifiable Credentials)
- Begin security implementation in Phase 2 (after design complete)
- Conduct community security review before mainnet deployment (Phase 3)
