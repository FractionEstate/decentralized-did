| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **Cardano transaction speed** | 20 tx/sec limit | Batch enrollments, use Hydra L2 for scaling |
| **CIP-68 metadata size** | 16 KB per transaction | Store helper data off-chain (IPFS) |
| **IPFS availability** | Files may be unpinned | Require 3+ pinning nodes, monitor availability |
| **Browser biometric APIs** | Limited to WebAuthn (fingerprint) | Use native apps for advanced biometrics |
| **Mobile sensor quality** | Varies by device | Enforce NFIQ ≥50 quality threshold |
| **Wallet compatibility** | CIP-30 adoption varies | Provide fallback (demo wallet) |

### 7.2 Business Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **No paid services** | Limited infrastructure options | Self-host all services (IPFS, PostgreSQL, backend) |
| **Open-source only** | Cannot use commercial SDKs | Use SourceAFIS, NBIS, commodity sensors |
| **Budget limitations** | No professional audits (Phase 1) | Rely on community security reviews, bug bounty |
| **Timeline (hackathon)** | December 2025 deadline | Focus on MVP (essential features only) |
| **Team size** | 1-3 developers (Phase 1) | Automate testing, use existing libraries |

### 7.3 Regulatory Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **GDPR Article 9** | Biometric data is "special category" | Explicit consent, DPIA, encryption, revocation |
| **Illinois BIPA** | Requires written policy, retention limits | Document policy, implement data deletion |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | Data subject rights (access, deletion) | Build DSR portal, audit logs |
| **eIDAS (EU)** | May require eID notified status | Out of scope (Phase 1-3), research for Phase 4 |

### 7.4 Assumptions

**User Behavior:**
- Users have Cardano wallet (or willing to install demo wallet)
- Users have fingerprint sensor (laptop, phone, USB reader)
- Users accept 0.2 ADA enrollment cost
- Users understand biometric privacy implications
- Users prefer self-custody over custodial solutions

**Technical:**
- Cardano mainnet remains stable (no major protocol changes)
- IPFS network remains available (sufficient pinning nodes)
- Ed25519 remains secure (no cryptographic breaks)
- BCH(127,64,10) provides sufficient error correction (10-bit errors)
- SourceAFIS minutiae extraction is accurate (FAR <0.01%)

**Ecosystem:**
- CIP-30 adoption continues to grow (wallet integrations)
- W3C DID/VC standards remain stable (no breaking changes)
- Cardano community supports open-source identity solutions
- No competing did:cardano method emerges (we propose CIP first)

### 10.1 Requirements Change Process

1. **Proposal:** Stakeholder submits change request (GitHub issue)
2. **Review:** Engineering team assesses impact (effort, dependencies, risks)
3. **Prioritization:** Product owner ranks against existing roadmap
4. **Approval:** Team vote (majority consensus)
5. **Documentation:** Update this requirements document (version increment)
6. **Communication:** Announce in Discord, update GitHub project board

### 10.2 Scope Control

**Criteria for Accepting Changes:**
- ✅ Aligns with open-source constraint
- ✅ Addresses critical security vulnerability
- ✅ Required for regulatory compliance (GDPR, BIPA)
- ✅ High community demand (>50% survey support)
- ✅ Low implementation effort (<1 week)

**Criteria for Rejecting Changes:**
- ❌ Requires paid services or proprietary software
- ❌ Violates privacy principles (SSI, GDPR)
- ❌ Exceeds budget constraints
- ❌ Delays Phase 1 delivery beyond December 2025
- ❌ Low community demand (<20% survey support)

### 10.3 Version History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2025-10-10 | DID Research Team | Initial requirements from Phase 0 research |
| 1.1 | TBD | TBD | Post-hackathon feedback incorporation |
| 2.0 | TBD | TBD | Phase 2 (testnet) requirements update |

## 11. Conclusion

This requirements specification consolidates findings from Phase 0 research and stakeholder engagement. It defines 60+ functional requirements, 35+ non-functional requirements, and clear success metrics for the biometric DID system on Cardano.

**Key Takeaways:**

✅ **Privacy-First:** GDPR Article 9 compliance, unlinkable DIDs, encrypted storage, minimal on-chain data
✅ **Open-Source:** All tools (SourceAFIS, PyCardano, DIDKit), no paid services, community-driven governance
✅ **Standards-Compliant:** W3C DID/VC, did:cardano method, Ed25519 signatures, SSI principles
✅ **Secure:** Multi-layered presentation attack defense, constant-time operations, formal verification
✅ **Cost-Effective:** ≤0.2 ADA per enrollment, self-hosted infrastructure
✅ **Interoperable:** W3C standards enable cross-chain VC validation (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot)

**Next Steps:**
- **Phase 1:** Architectural design (system design, API specifications, database schema)
- **Phase 2:** Implementation (MVP development, testing)
- **Phase 3:** Deployment (hackathon demo, testnet launch)
- **Phase 4+:** Enhancements (zkSNARKs, PoP integration, cross-chain demos)

**Phase 0 Research Complete:** 7/7 tasks finished (100%)
**Phase 1 Design:** Ready to begin with comprehensive requirements foundation
