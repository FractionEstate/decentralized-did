### üîú Upcoming Focus

1. **Task 2 - Hardware Integration**: Resume Eikon Touch 700 USB sensor work once hardware is provisioned.
2. **Task 7 - Integration Testing & Validation**: Execute cross-environment API + wallet suites (Playwright, Jest, k6, OWASP ZAP) using new deployment assets.
3. **Task 8 - Documentation Updates**: Consolidate Phase 4.6 deliverables into public docs (performance tuning, troubleshooting, hardware guide).
4. **Task 9 - Optional Testnet Deployment**: Publish validation report if testnet rollout is exercised.

## Near-Term (Quarter 1)
- Land biometric metadata storage and approval UI inside the demo wallet (peer connection + signing screens).
- Publish TypeScript bindings (or JSON schema) for wallet integrators beyond Veridian.
- Build automated fixtures that validate CLI-generated bundles round-trip inside the wallet (unit + e2e).
- Conduct informal security review with community experts focusing on helper data handling.

## Mid-Term (Quarter 2)
- Launch managed enrollment node with secure hardware support (YubiKey Bio, Apple Secure Enclave).
- Draft CIP for standardized biometric metadata structure.
- Build Plutus validator that requires matching biometric digest for access-controlled actions.
- Implement zero-knowledge proof flow for selective disclosure (e.g., age attestations).

## Long-Term (Quarter 3+)
- Formal audits of biometric pipeline and helper data storage.
- Multi-factor composability (biometric digest + social recovery + device attestations).
- Decentralized registry anchored on Cardano sidechain or Mithril snapshots.
- Explore interoperability with W3C DID Core and verifiable credentials.
