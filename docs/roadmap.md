## üöÄ Phase 5: Production Readiness & Advanced Features (PLANNED)

**Goal**: Make the system production-ready with hardware integration, security hardening, and real-world deployment capabilities.

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Status**: Planning phase

### Proposed Focus Areas

1. **Demo Wallet Deterministic DID Integration**
   - Update demo-wallet to use deterministic DID generation
   - Replace wallet-based format with new format

   - Update all UI components and storage

2. **Hardware Integration Continuation**
   - Complete fingerprint sensor integration (paused after Phase 4)
   - Implement Eikon Touch 700 USB sensor support
   - Real minutiae extraction and DID generation
   - Replace mock capture with real hardware

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Rate limiting (per-IP, per-wallet)
   - Authentication for API endpoints
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Request validation and sanitization
   - DDoS protection

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching layer for blockchain queries
   - Connection pooling
   - Async operations for I/O
   - Performance monitoring and metrics
   - Load testing and benchmarks

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Docker containerization
   - Nginx reverse proxy configuration
   - SSL/TLS certificate setup
   - Environment configuration management
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Backup and disaster recovery

### Next Steps

- Define detailed Phase 5 tasks in `.github/tasks.md`
- Create Phase 5 kickoff document
- Prioritize based on business needs
- Set sprint milestones

### Phase 4: Biometric DID Wallet Integration (10/10 tasks COMPLETE) ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Finalized the biometric metadata ingestion plan for the bundled `demo-wallet` (Veridian fork).
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Defined the experimental CIP-30 bridge (store metadata bundle, surface approval UX, persist helper URI).
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Published contributor guidance (`copilot-instructions.md`) and kept roadmap/docs cross-referenced.
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Captured integration test scenarios that exercise Python CLI output against the wallet flow.
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Delivered the CLI "demo-kit" packaging command so demo operators can share consistent artifacts.
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Demo-wallet (Veridian) is 100% functional with biometric DID support (see `docs/demo-wallet-verification.md`).
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Integrated live CLI enrollment/verification flows into demo-wallet UI.
  - Full enrollment flow (10-finger sequential capture with progress tracking)
  - Verification flows (unlock wallet + transaction signing)
  - Backend API server (FastAPI + mock data) at http://localhost:8000
  - All UI components complete (BiometricEnrollment, BiometricVerification)
  - Route integration (BIOMETRIC_ENROLLMENT path)
  - Storage integration (SecureStorage for encrypted helper data)
  - Bug fixes: 2 critical issues resolved (infinite loop, storage error)
  - Documentation: 4,500+ lines across 7 comprehensive guides
  - **Status**: Mock mode fully functional, ready for real hardware integration
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: Uses old wallet-based DID format - needs update to deterministic (Phase 4.5)

### Production Hardening (PAUSED - Waiting for Phase 4.5)

  - Research complete: 4 strategies documented (WebAuthn, libfprint, Platform APIs, OpenCV)
  - Hardware recommendation: Eikon Touch 700 USB sensor ($25-30)

- ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED**: Upgrade API server from mock to real CLI integration
  - **Blocked by**: Phase 4.5 completion (API servers need deterministic DID)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED**: Security hardening (rate limiting, authentication, audit logging)
  - **Blocked by**: Phase 4.5 completion (security architecture alignment)
- ‚è≥ **PLANNED**: Performance optimization (caching, monitoring, connection pooling)
- ‚è≥ **PLANNED**: Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E tests)
- ‚è≥ **PLANNED**: Production deployment guide (Docker, Nginx, SSL/TLS)

## Near-Term (Quarter 1)
- Land biometric metadata storage and approval UI inside the demo wallet (peer connection + signing screens).
- Publish TypeScript bindings (or JSON schema) for wallet integrators beyond Veridian.
- Build automated fixtures that validate CLI-generated bundles round-trip inside the wallet (unit + e2e).
- Conduct informal security review with community experts focusing on helper data handling.

## Mid-Term (Quarter 2)
- Launch managed enrollment node with secure hardware support (YubiKey Bio, Apple Secure Enclave).
- Draft CIP for standardized biometric metadata structure.
- Build Plutus validator that requires matching biometric digest for access-controlled actions.
- Implement zero-knowledge proof flow for selective disclosure (e.g., age attestations).

## Long-Term (Quarter 3+)
- Formal audits of biometric pipeline and helper data storage.
- Multi-factor composability (biometric digest + social recovery + device attestations).
- Decentralized registry anchored on Cardano sidechain or Mithril snapshots.
- Explore interoperability with W3C DID Core and verifiable credentials.
