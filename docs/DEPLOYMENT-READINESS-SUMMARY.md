**Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

### ⏳ Deferred to Operational Phase

| Item | Priority | Reason | Timeline |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Full load testing execution | Medium | Infrastructure ready, guides complete, execution time-intensive | Week 1-2 post-launch |
| OWASP ZAP automated scans | Medium | Guides ready, execution requires staging environment | Week 1 post-launch |
| Security checklist completion | Medium | Manual verification items, non-blocking | Ongoing |
| Performance benchmark automation | Low | Manual testing confirms functionality, async timeout issues | Week 2-3 post-launch |
| Hardware sensor integration | Low | Mock data sufficient for launch, real hardware optional | Phase 7 (future) |

**Rationale**: These items do not block production deployment. Infrastructure and guides are complete, enabling operational teams to execute as needed.

## Deployment Recommendations

### Phase 1: Initial Rollout (Week 1)

1. **Deploy to Staging Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/decentralized-did
   ./deploy-production.sh --staging
   ```
   - Test all three API servers (basic, secure, mock)
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Confirm nginx reverse proxy
   - Test demo wallet connectivity

2. **Run Manual Smoke Tests**:
   - Enrollment: Generate DID from 2-4 fingerprints
   - Verification: Verify identity with noisy recapture
   - Duplicate detection: Attempt re-enrollment (should fail with 409)
   - Multi-controller: Add/remove controller wallets

3. **Monitor System Health**:
   - Check `/health` endpoints every 60s
   - Monitor `/metrics/koios` for query performance
   - Review audit logs for anomalies
   - Track API response times

4. **Backup Confirmation**:
   ```bash
   ./backup.sh --verify
   # Ensure backups written to /var/backups/did-api/
   ```

### Phase 2: Limited Production (Week 2-3)

1. **Enable for Beta Users** (10-50 users):
   - Whitelist wallet addresses in rate limiter
   - Monitor enrollment success rates
   - Collect user feedback

2. **Execute Deferred Tests** (as operational capacity allows):
   ```bash
   # OWASP ZAP scan
   # Follow: docs/security/owasp-zap-guide.md

   # Load testing
   # Follow: docs/security/load-testing-guide.md
   k6 run tests/load/enrollment-load.js
   ```

3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Adjust Koios cache TTL based on hit rates
   - Tune rate limits based on actual usage patterns
   - Scale workers if needed (`--workers 4` → `--workers 8`)

4. **Security Audit** (optional, recommended):
   - Third-party penetration testing
   - Code review by external security experts
   - Compliance verification (GDPR, BIPA)

### Phase 3: General Availability (Week 4+)

1. **Public Launch**:
   - Remove beta restrictions
   - Announce on Cardano community channels
   - Open source repository public

2. **Ongoing Operations**:
   - Daily backup verification
   - Weekly SSL renewal checks
   - Monthly security scan (OWASP ZAP)
   - Quarterly performance review

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - GitHub issues for bug reports
   - Discord/forum for support
   - Regular roadmap updates

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| Koios API downtime | Medium | Fallback to alternative instances, local cache | ✅ Mitigated |
| DDoS attack | Medium | Rate limiting, CloudFlare proxy | ✅ Mitigated |
| Biometric spoofing | Low | Liveness detection (Phase 7), enrollment audit | ⏳ Future |
| SSL certificate expiration | Low | Automated renewal, monitoring | ✅ Mitigated |
| Database compromise | Low | No biometric storage, helper data encrypted | ✅ Mitigated |
| Regulatory compliance | Medium | GDPR compliance documented, right to erasure | ✅ Mitigated |

**Overall Risk Level**: ✅ **LOW** (all high/critical risks mitigated)

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   git checkout <previous-stable-tag>
   ./deploy-production.sh
   ```

2. **Data Preservation**:
   - Backup current state: `./backup.sh --emergency`
   - Preserve audit logs: `cp /var/log/did-api/* /var/backups/audit-logs/`

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify users via status page
   - Post incident report on GitHub
   - Update Discord/community channels

4. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Review server logs: `/tmp/api_server_*.log`
   - Check audit logs: `/var/log/did-api/audit.log`
   - Analyze errors: `grep -i error /var/log/nginx/error.log`
