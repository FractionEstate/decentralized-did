## 🚀 Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance

| Operation | Target | Acceptable | Test Assertion |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Enrollment (3 fingers) | < 2s | < 5s | ✅ Enforced |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### WebAuthn Mock Architecture

```typescript
class WebAuthnMock {
  // Install mock into page context
  async install(page: Page): Promise<void>

  // Enroll biometric with specific characteristics
  async enrollBiometric(page: Page, fingerId: string, quality: number): Promise<MockBiometricData>

  // Get enrollment/verification data
  async getLastEnrollment(page: Page): Promise<MockBiometricData | null>
  async getLastVerification(page: Page): Promise<MockBiometricData | null>

  // Clean up
  async clearEnrollments(page: Page): Promise<void>
}
```

### API Client Architecture

```typescript
class BiometricApiClient {
  // Health check
  async checkHealth(): Promise<any>

  // Enrollment
  async generate(request: GenerateRequest): Promise<GenerateResponse>

  // Verification
  async verify(request: VerifyRequest): Promise<VerifyResponse>

  // Rate limiting test
  async testRateLimit(endpoint: string, requests: number): Promise<{successful: number, rateLimited: number}>
}
```

### Custom Assertions

```typescript
biometricAssertions.assertValidDid(did: string)
biometricAssertions.assertValidWalletBundle(bundle: any)
biometricAssertions.assertValidHelperData(helpers: Record<string, any>, expectedFingers: string[])
biometricAssertions.assertValidVerification(response: any, expectedVerified: boolean, expectedMatchedCount: number)
```

### 3. Performance Testing
**Challenge**: Ensuring production-ready performance
**Solution**: Explicit timing measurements with threshold assertions

### 4. CI/CD Integration
**Challenge**: Running tests in headless environment
**Solution**: Playwright with Chromium headless mode, automated API startup
