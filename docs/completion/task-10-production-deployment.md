- Environment variable validation
- Secret generation verification
- Directory creation (logs, data, nginx/ssl)
- SSL certificate handling (Let's Encrypt or self-signed)

**`scripts/backup.sh`** - Backup automation:
- Docker volume backup (logs, data)
- Configuration backup (.env, docker-compose.yml, nginx/)

- Configurable retention (default 30 days)
- Backup verification and summary

**`scripts/restore.sh`** - Disaster recovery:

- Safety confirmations
- Service shutdown
- Volume, configuration, and SSL restoration
- Service restart with health checks

**`scripts/health-check.sh`** - Monitoring:
- Docker daemon check
- Container status (all 3 services)
- API endpoint health (/health)
- Demo wallet accessibility
- Disk space monitoring (warning at 60%, critical at 80%)
- Log size monitoring (warning at 1GB)
- SSL certificate expiry (warning at 30 days, critical at 7 days)
- Memory usage per container
- Color-coded output (green, yellow, red)
