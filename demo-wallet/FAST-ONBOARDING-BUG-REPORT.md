# Fast Onboarding Bug Report

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL BUGS FOUND

## Summary

Testing revealed several critical issues that block the fast onboarding flow from working end-to-end.

## Bugs Found

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Bug #1: Error Dialog on Initial Load (FIXED ‚úÖ)

**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Description**:
When navigating to `/onboarding`, an error dialog appeared immediately: "Something went wrong. Please try again."

**Root Cause**:
In `Onboarding.tsx`, the fast onboarding flow was setting `step: 4` before `walletAddress` was available. The render condition `state.step === 4 && state.walletAddress` failed, causing React to render nothing and trigger error boundary.

**Fix Applied**:

- Changed fast onboarding flow to await wallet creation before setting step to 4
- Updated SuccessScreen render condition to show loading state if wallet is still being created
- Now wallet creation completes before transitioning to SuccessScreen

**Files Changed**:

- `demo-wallet/src/ui/pages/Onboarding/Onboarding.tsx` (lines 95-110)

---

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Bug #2: Misleading SuccessScreen Messaging (FIXED ‚úÖ)

**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Description**:
The SuccessScreen showed "‚úÖ Backup seed phrase saved" and "‚úÖ Verification passed" even in fast onboarding mode where the user skipped both steps.

**Root Cause**:
SuccessScreen didn't accept a `fastOnboarding` prop to differentiate between traditional and fast onboarding flows.

**Fix Applied**:

- Added `fastOnboarding?: boolean` prop to SuccessScreen interface
- Updated checklist items to show:
  - Fast mode: "‚è±Ô∏è Seed phrase saved (backup later)" and "‚úÖ Wallet created"
  - Traditional mode: "‚úÖ Backup seed phrase saved" and "‚úÖ Verification passed"
- Passed `state.fastOnboarding` from Onboarding component to SuccessScreen

**Files Changed**:

- `demo-wallet/src/ui/pages/Onboarding/SuccessScreen.tsx` (lines 5-7, 37-43)
- `demo-wallet/src/ui/pages/Onboarding/Onboarding.tsx` (line 314)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Bug #3: Infinite Loading After Onboarding Completion (NOT FIXED ‚ùå)

**Severity**: **CRITICAL** - Blocks entire fast onboarding flow
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED

**Description**:
After clicking "Start Using Wallet ‚Üí" on the SuccessScreen, the app navigates to `/tabs/credentials` but shows an infinite loading spinner. The page never loads, making the wallet completely unusable.

**Root Cause**:
The `createWalletWithBiometric` function is a mock that doesn't actually initialize the Agent system. When the Credentials tab tries to load, it waits for Agent initialization that never completes.

**Evidence**:

```javascript
// Current mock implementation (Onboarding.tsx line 287)
async function createWalletWithBiometric(
  biometricData: string[],
  seedPhrase: string[],
  seedPhraseBackedUp: boolean = true
): Promise<string> {
  // Only stores flag, doesn't initialize Agent
  if (!seedPhraseBackedUp) {
    await Agent.agent.basicStorage.createOrUpdateBasicRecord(...);
  }

  // Returns mock address after 1 second timeout
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("addr1q9xyz...abc123");
    }, 1000);
  });
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:

1. Create actual wallet using Agent.createIdentifier()
2. Store seed phrase securely
3. Initialize Agent with new wallet
4. Store wallet state in Redux
5. Store seedPhraseBackedUp flag
6. Navigate to tabs only after Agent is ready

**Required Fix**:

- Implement full Agent initialization in `createWalletWithBiometric`
- Follow existing wallet creation patterns from the codebase
- Ensure Agent is ready before navigation
- Add proper error handling for wallet creation failures

**Files Affected**:

- `demo-wallet/src/ui/pages/Onboarding/Onboarding.tsx` (lines 287-308)
- Possibly: `demo-wallet/src/core/agent/agent.ts` (need to use real Agent methods)

**Impact**:

- ‚ùå Fast onboarding flow completely non-functional
- ‚ùå Traditional onboarding likely has same issue
- ‚ùå Cannot test BackupWarningBanner (blocked by infinite loading)
- ‚ùå Cannot test DeferredBackup page (blocked by infinite loading)

**Testing Blockers**:

- Cannot reach tabs view to test BackupWarningBanner appearance
- Cannot navigate to DeferredBackup page
- Cannot test "Backup Now" button functionality
- Cannot test seed phrase verification flow

---

## Testing Results

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **WelcomeScreen**: Shows 3 recovery options correctly (Create / Seed / Biometry)
2. **BiometricScanScreen**: Loads and captures fingerprints (auto-skips in dev mode)
3. **SuccessScreen**: Shows correct messaging for fast onboarding mode
4. **Navigation**: Routing from onboarding ‚Üí success ‚Üí tabs works
5. **State Management**: `fastOnboarding` flag properly tracks onboarding mode

### ‚ùå Blocked Testing (Due to Bug #3)

1. **BackupWarningBanner**: Cannot test (stuck on infinite loading)
2. **DeferredBackup page**: Cannot test (cannot navigate to tabs)
3. **Backup completion flow**: Cannot test (cannot reach deferred backup)
4. **Banner persistence**: Cannot test (cannot access tabs after onboarding)
5. **Traditional onboarding**: Cannot test (likely has same Agent initialization issue)

---

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Agent Initialization (Bug #3)

1. **Research**: Find existing Agent initialization patterns in codebase

   - Check how `Agent.createIdentifier()` is used elsewhere
   - Look for wallet creation in recovery flows
   - Find where seed phrases are stored/encrypted

2. **Implement**: Replace mock `createWalletWithBiometric` with real implementation

   - Use proper Agent APIs
   - Store seed phrase securely
   - Initialize Agent state
   - Update Redux store with wallet info
   - Handle errors properly

3. **Test**: Verify complete flow
   - Fast onboarding completes without hanging
   - Tabs load successfully after onboarding
   - Agent is initialized and ready
   - Wallet address is real (not mock)

### Priority 2: Complete Integration Testing

After Bug #3 is fixed:

1. Test BackupWarningBanner appearance in tabs
2. Test DeferredBackup page navigation and display
3. Test seed phrase verification (3 random words, 4 options each)
4. Test banner dismissal and persistence
5. Test traditional onboarding flow (with immediate backup)
6. Test recovery flows (seed phrase + biometry)

### Priority 3: Additional Improvements

1. Add loading states/progress indicators during wallet creation
2. Improve error messages if wallet creation fails
3. Add retry logic for failed wallet creation
4. Add analytics/logging for onboarding completion
5. Add unit tests for fast onboarding flow
6. Add E2E tests for complete onboarding flows

## Developer Notes

### Files Modified (This Session)

1. `Onboarding.tsx` - Fixed async wallet creation timing (Bug #1)
2. `SuccessScreen.tsx` - Added fast onboarding messaging (Bug #2)

### Files Still Need Work

1. `Onboarding.tsx` - Replace mock wallet creation with real Agent initialization
2. Possibly need to update `Agent` class or related services

### Time Estimates

- **Bug #3 Fix**: 2-4 hours (depends on Agent API complexity)
- **Integration Testing**: 1-2 hours (after Bug #3 fixed)
- **Additional Improvements**: 4-6 hours (can be done later)

## Conclusion

**Good News**:

- Fast onboarding UI/UX is solid
- WelcomeScreen, BiometricScanScreen, and SuccessScreen work correctly
- State management and routing work as expected
- Two bugs fixed (Bug #1, Bug #2)

**Bad News**:

- **Critical blocker**: Agent initialization missing (Bug #3)
- Cannot complete end-to-end testing until Bug #3 fixed
- Fast onboarding is non-functional in current state

**Recommendation**:
**DO NOT DEPLOY** until Bug #3 is resolved. The current implementation will leave users stuck on infinite loading screen after completing onboarding, making the wallet completely unusable.
