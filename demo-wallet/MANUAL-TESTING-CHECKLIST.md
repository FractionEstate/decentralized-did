## Checklist Template (Retained for Future Runs)

## Overview

This checklist covers manual testing to validate the deterministic DID implementation in the demo wallet. All automated tests are passing (18 unit + 5 integration + 11 E2E = 34 tests), but manual validation is needed to ensure production readiness.

**What's Being Tested**:

- ✅ Deterministic DID generation (Blake2b + Base58)
- ✅ Metadata v1.1 format (multi-controller support)
- ✅ Sybil resistance (one person = one DID)
- ✅ Privacy preservation (no wallet address in DID)
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Simplified onboarding UI alignment (10-finger capture, Cardano wallet visuals)

**What's Deferred to Task 4**:

- 🔄 9 API-dependent integration tests (require JWT auth)
- 🔄 7 E2E verification tests (require API structure updates)
