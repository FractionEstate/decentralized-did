# Overview

<div align="justify">
  <b>
    Veridian Wallet is an open source application developed by the Cardano Foundation.
    This project is the result of on-going research and development pertaining to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Self-Certifying Identifiers (SCIs), Verifiable Data Registries (VDRs), and the standards, frameworks, and implementations available within the Cardano ecosystem and externally.
    The first release of the wallet provides an open source implementation demonstrating the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) on Cardano.
    This wallet has undergone security auditing and penetration testing, and mitigations have been applied.

# Features

- :iphone: Android & iOS Support with native biometrics
- :cloud: High messaging availability with a KERIA cloud agent
- :closed_lock_with_key: Secure Enclave (SE) / Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) usage for seeds & secrets
- :fingerprint: **Biometric Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** - Privacy-preserving, Sybil-resistant identity
  - Deterministic DID generation from biometric data (fingerprints)
  - One person = One DID (Sybil resistance)
  - Privacy-preserving: No wallet address in DID identifier
  - Multi-controller support for flexible identity management
  - Fuzzy extractor technology for error-tolerant biometric matching
- :id: KERI autonomic identifiers
  - Securely backed by a combination of KERI native witnesses and Cardano
  - Single-sig, group multi-sig
- :ticket: ACDC credentials exchanged using the IPEX protocol
- :zap: Efficient over-the-wire communications using CESR encoding
- :desktop_computer: dApp integration using [CIP-45](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0045)

## Biometric Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

This wallet implements a novel biometric DID system that combines privacy preservation with Sybil resistance:

### Key Features

- **Deterministic DID Generation**: DIDs are generated deterministically from biometric data using cryptographic hashing (Blake2b + Base58 encoding)
- **Format**: `did:cardano:{network}:{hash}` where network is `mainnet`, `testnet`, or `preprod`
- **Sybil Resistance**: One person can only have one DID, regardless of how many wallet addresses they control
- **Privacy-Preserving**: DID identifier does not contain or reveal wallet addresses
- **Multi-Controller Support**: One identity can be controlled by multiple wallet addresses (metadata v1.1)
- **Revocable**: DIDs can be marked as revoked with timestamps for compliance

### How It Works

1. **Enrollment**: User scans 2-10 fingerprints ‚Üí Fuzzy extractor generates cryptographic commitment ‚Üí DID created from commitment hash
2. **Verification**: User rescans fingers ‚Üí Helper data enables key reconstruction ‚Üí Identity verified without exposing biometric data
3. **Storage**: Helper data stored securely (inline in metadata or external URI), biometric templates never leave device

### Security Properties

- ‚úÖ **Sybil Resistant**: Same biometric = same DID (prevents multiple accounts)
- ‚úÖ **Privacy Preserving**: No PII in DID identifier
- ‚úÖ **Fuzzy Matching**: Tolerates natural biometric variations (noise, positioning)
- ‚úÖ **Non-Reversible**: Cannot reconstruct biometric from DID or helper data
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain-Anchored**: DIDs recorded on Cardano blockchain for immutability

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Node.js: Version 20.
- npm: Compatible with the Node.js version.
- **Java: OpenJDK 21 (LTS)** - Required for Android builds. The project uses Java 21 features and Android Gradle Plugin 8.7.2.
- Xcode: For iOS emulation (latest version recommended).
- Android Studio: For Android emulation (latest version recommended).
- Capacitor: Version 7.0.0 (refer to package.json). For detailed environment setup, refer to the [Capacitor Environment Setup Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup).
- Mobile Device: iOS or Android for running the app on physical devices.
- Docker, Docker Compose.

Ensure that your system meets these requirements to successfully use and develop the Identity Wallet application.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/veridian-wallet.git
cd veridian-wallet
make init # This will configure the git hooks
```

## Preparing the App

This project uses a specific node version (check the requirements section above). You can optionally use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage and switch between different Node.js versions on your computer.

Before running the App, ensure that all dependencies are installed and the app is built properly.
In the project root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running in the Browser

The development server depends on a local KERIA and credential issuance server setup.
The [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yaml) file can be used to quickly bring these services up.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server and allows you to preview the application on your browser by opening this localhost address:

[http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/)

## Running in an Emulator

You can discover how to run the application in an emulator by following this [link](docs/Running-in-an-Emulator.md).

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

You can gain additional insights into end-to-end testing by visiting the provided [link](docs/Testing.md).
